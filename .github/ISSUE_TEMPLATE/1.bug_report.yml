        This template is to report Next.js bugs. If you need help with your project, you can:
        - Start a discussion in the ["Help" section](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/categories/help)
        - Ask a question on the [Next.js Discord](https://discord.com/invite/nextjs) server
        
        [Examples](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples) related issues should be reported using [this](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/new?assignees=&labels=type%3A+example%2Ctemplate%3A+bug&template=2.example_bug_report.yml) issue template instead.
        Feature requests should be opened as [discussions](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/new?category=ideas). [Read more](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/contributing/core/adding-features.md).
  - type: input
    attributes:
      label: Link to the code that reproduces this issue or a replay of the bug
      description: |
        A link to a **public** [GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/reproduction-template) or a [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/github/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/reproduction-template) minimal reproduction. Minimal reproductions should be created from our [bug report template with `npx create-next-app -e reproduction-template`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/reproduction-template) and should include only changes that contribute to the issue.
        
        If a minimal reproduction can't be created please share a [replay](https://www.replay.io/) of the bug which doesn't require sharing a private repo.
        To report a Pages Router related issue, you can use these templates: [`npx create-next-app -e reproduction-template-pages`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/reproduction-template-pages) or [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/github/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/reproduction-template-pages)
