# Adding a new feature

Anyone can propose a change to Next.js. However, adding new features often requires community discussions.

Things to consider:

- Aligning expectations
- Understanding the consequences with regards to:
  - Backward compatibility
  - The lifetime of a feature
- to look at and understand historical reasons for the current behavior or lack of the feature -, which GitHub discussions is more suited for than issues.
