description: An overview of essential React features for building Next.js Applications, including Server Components.
---

If we were to split the page into smaller components, you'll notice that the majority of components are non-interactive and can be rendered on the server as Server Components. For smaller pieces of interactive UI, we can _sprinkle in_ Client Components. This aligns with Next.js server-first approach.

## Client Components

Client Components enable you to add client-side interactivity to your application. In Next.js, they are [pre-rendered](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering) on the server and hydrated on the client. You can think of Client Components as how components in the [Pages Router](/docs/pages) have always worked.

### The "use client" directive

The [`"use client"` directive](https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/pull/227) is a convention to declare a boundary between a Server and Client Component module graph.

```tsx filename="app/counter.tsx" highlight={1} switcher
'use client'

import { useState } from 'react'

export default function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

```jsx filename="app/counter.js" highlight={1} switcher
'use client'

import { useState } from 'react'

export default function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

/>

`"use client"` _sits_ between server-only and client code. It's placed at the top of a file, above imports, to define the _cut-off_ point where it crosses the boundary from the server-only to the client part. Once `"use client"` is defined in a file, all other modules imported into it, including child components, are considered part of the client bundle.

Since Server Components are the default, all components are part of the Server Component module graph unless defined or imported in a module that starts with the `"use client"` directive.

> **Good to know**:
>
> - Components in the Server Component module graph are guaranteed to be only rendered on the server.
> - Components in the Client Component module graph are primarily rendered on the client, but with Next.js, they can also be pre-rendered on the server and hydrated on the client.
> - The `"use client"` directive must be defined at the **top of a file** before any imports.
> - `"use client"` does **not** need to be defined in every file. The Client module boundary only needs to be defined once, at the "entry point", for all modules imported into it to be considered a Client Component.

## When to use Server and Client Components?

To simplify the decision between Server and Client Components, we recommend using Server Components (default in the `app` directory) until you have a use case for a Client Component.

This table summarizes the different use cases for Server and Client Components:

| What do you need to do?                                                            | Server Component    | Client Component    |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- |
| Fetch data.                                                                        | <Check size={18} /> | <Cross size={18} /> |
| Access backend resources (directly)                                                | <Check size={18} /> | <Cross size={18} /> |
| Keep sensitive information on the server (access tokens, API keys, etc)            | <Check size={18} /> | <Cross size={18} /> |
| Keep large dependencies on the server / Reduce client-side JavaScript              | <Check size={18} /> | <Cross size={18} /> |
| Add interactivity and event listeners (`onClick()`, `onChange()`, etc)             | <Cross size={18} /> | <Check size={18} /> |
| Use State and Lifecycle Effects (`useState()`, `useReducer()`, `useEffect()`, etc) | <Cross size={18} /> | <Check size={18} /> |
| Use browser-only APIs                                                              | <Cross size={18} /> | <Check size={18} /> |
| Use custom hooks that depend on state, effects, or browser-only APIs               | <Cross size={18} /> | <Check size={18} /> |
| Use [React Class components](https://react.dev/reference/react/Component)          | <Cross size={18} /> | <Check size={18} /> |

## Patterns

### Keeping Server-Only Code out of Client Components (Poisoning)

Since JavaScript modules can be shared between both Server and Client Components, it's possible for code that was only ever intended to be run on the server to sneak its way into the client.

For example, take the following data-fetching function:

```ts filename="lib/data.ts" switcher
export async function getData() {
  const res = await fetch('https://external-service.com/data', {
    headers: {
      authorization: process.env.API_KEY,
    },
  })

  return res.json()
}
```

```js filename="lib/data.js" switcher
export async function getData() {
  const res = await fetch('https://external-service.com/data', {
    headers: {
      authorization: process.env.API_KEY,
    },
  })

  return res.json()
}
```

At first glance, it appears that `getData` works on both the server and the client. But because the environment variable `API_KEY` is not prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC`, it's a private variable that can only be accessed on the server. Next.js replaces private environment variables with the empty string in client code to prevent leaking secure information.

As a result, even though `getData()` can be imported and executed on the client, it won't work as expected. And while making the variable public would make the function work on the client, it would leak sensitive information.

So, this function was written with the intention that it would only ever be executed on the server.

### The "server only" package

To prevent this sort of unintended client usage of server code, we can use the `server-only` package to give other developers a build-time error if they ever accidentally import one of these modules into a Client Component.

To use `server-only`, first install the package:

```bash filename="Terminal"
npm install server-only
```

Then import the package into any module that contains server-only code:

```js filename="lib/data.js"
import 'server-only'

export async function getData() {
  const res = await fetch('https://external-service.com/data', {
    headers: {
      authorization: process.env.API_KEY,
    },
  })

  return res.json()
}
```

Now, any Client Component that imports `getData()` will receive a build-time error explaining that this module can only be used on the server.

The corresponding package `client-only` can be used to mark modules that contain client-only code â€“ for example, code that accesses the `window` object.

### Data Fetching

Although it's possible to fetch data in Client Components, we recommend fetching data in Server Components unless you have a specific reason for fetching data on the client. Moving data fetching to the server leads to better performance and user experience.

[Learn more about data fetching](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching).

### Third-party packages

Since Server Components are new, third-party packages in the ecosystem are just beginning to add the `"use client"` directive to components that use client-only features like `useState`, `useEffect`, and `createContext`.

Today, many components from `npm` packages that use client-only features do not yet have the directive. These third-party components will work as expected within your own [Client Components](#the-use-client-directive) since they have the `"use client"` directive, but they won't work within Server Components.

For example, let's say you've installed the hypothetical `acme-carousel` package which has a `<Carousel />` component. This component uses `useState`, but it doesn't yet have the `"use client"` directive.

If you use `<Carousel />` within a Client Component, it will work as expected:

```tsx filename="app/gallery.tsx" switcher
'use client'

import { useState } from 'react'
import { Carousel } from 'acme-carousel'

export default function Gallery() {
  let [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false)

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setIsOpen(true)}>View pictures</button>

      {/* Works, since Carousel is used within a Client Component */}
      {isOpen && <Carousel />}
    </div>
  )
}
```

```jsx filename="app/gallery.js" switcher
'use client'

import { useState } from 'react'
import { Carousel } from 'acme-carousel'

export default function Gallery() {
  let [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false)

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setIsOpen(true)}>View pictures</button>

      {/*  Works, since Carousel is used within a Client Component */}
      {isOpen && <Carousel />}
    </div>
  )
}
```

However, if you try to use it directly within a Server Component, you'll see an error:

```tsx filename="app/page.tsx" switcher
import { Carousel } from 'acme-carousel'

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>View pictures</p>

      {/* Error: `useState` can not be used within Server Components */}
      <Carousel />
    </div>
  )
}
```

```jsx filename="app/page.js" switcher
import { Carousel } from 'acme-carousel'

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>View pictures</p>

      {/*  Error: `useState` can not be used within Server Components */}
      <Carousel />
    </div>
  )
}
```

This is because Next.js doesn't know `<Carousel />` is using client-only features.

To fix this, you can wrap third-party components that rely on client-only features in your own Client Components:

```tsx filename="app/carousel.tsx" switcher
'use client'

import { Carousel } from 'acme-carousel'

export default Carousel
```

```jsx filename="app/carousel.js" switcher
'use client'

import { Carousel } from 'acme-carousel'

export default Carousel
```

Now, you can use `<Carousel />` directly within a Server Component:

```tsx filename="app/page.tsx" switcher
import Carousel from './carousel'

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>View pictures</p>

      {/*  Works, since Carousel is a Client Component */}
      <Carousel />
    </div>
  )
}
```

```jsx filename="app/page.js" switcher
import Carousel from './carousel'

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>View pictures</p>

      {/*  Works, since Carousel is a Client Component */}
      <Carousel />
    </div>
  )
}
```

We don't expect you to need to wrap most third-party components since it's likely you'll be using them within Client Components. However, one exception is provider components, since they rely on React state and context, and are typically needed at the root of an application. [Learn more about third-party context providers below](#rendering-third-party-context-providers-in-server-components).

#### Library Authors

- In a similar fashion, library authors creating packages to be consumed by other developers can use the `"use client"` directive to mark client entry points of their package. This allows users of the package to import package components directly into their Server Components without having to create a wrapping boundary.
- You can optimize your package by using ['use client' deeper in the tree](#moving-client-components-to-the-leaves), allowing the imported modules to be part of the Server Component module graph.
- It's worth noting some bundlers might strip out `"use client"` directives. You can find an example of how to configure esbuild to include the `"use client"` directive in the [React Wrap Balancer](https://github.com/shuding/react-wrap-balancer/blob/main/tsup.config.ts#L10-L13) and [Vercel Analytics](https://github.com/vercel/analytics/blob/main/packages/web/tsup.config.js#L26-L30) repositories.

## Context

Most React applications rely on [context](https://react.dev/reference/react/useContext) to share data between components, either directly via [`createContext`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useContext), or indirectly via provider components imported from third-party libraries.

In Next.js 13, context is fully supported within Client Components, but it **cannot** be created or consumed directly within Server Components. This is because Server Components have no React state (since they're not interactive), and context is primarily used for rerendering interactive components deep in the tree after some React state has been updated.

We'll discuss alternatives for sharing data between Server Components, but first, let's take a look at how to use context within Client Components.

### Using context in Client Components

All of the context APIs are fully supported within Client Components:

```tsx filename="app/sidebar.tsx" switcher
'use client'

import { createContext, useContext, useState } from 'react'

const SidebarContext = createContext()

export function Sidebar() {
  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState()

  return (
    <SidebarContext.Provider value={{ isOpen }}>
      <SidebarNav />
    </SidebarContext.Provider>
  )
}

function SidebarNav() {
  let { isOpen } = useContext(SidebarContext)

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Home</p>

      {isOpen && <Subnav />}
    </div>
  )
}
```

```jsx filename="app/sidebar.js" switcher
'use client'

import { createContext, useContext, useState } from 'react'

const SidebarContext = createContext()

export function Sidebar() {
  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState()

  return (
    <SidebarContext.Provider value={{ isOpen }}>
      <SidebarNav />
    </SidebarContext.Provider>
  )
}

function SidebarNav() {
  let { isOpen } = useContext(SidebarContext)

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Home</p>

      {isOpen && <Subnav />}
    </div>
  )
}
```

However, context providers are typically rendered near the root of an application to share global concerns, like the current theme. Because context is not supported in Server Components, trying to create a context at the root of your application will cause an error:

```tsx filename="app/layout.tsx" switcher
import { createContext } from 'react'

//  createContext is not supported in Server Components
export const ThemeContext = createContext({})

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html>
      <body>
        <ThemeContext.Provider value="dark">{children}</ThemeContext.Provider>
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

```jsx filename="app/layout.js" switcher
import { createContext } from 'react'

//  createContext is not supported in Server Components
export const ThemeContext = createContext({})

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html>
      <body>
        <ThemeContext.Provider value="dark">{children}</ThemeContext.Provider>
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

To fix this, create your context and render its provider inside of a Client Component:

```tsx filename="app/theme-provider.tsx" switcher
'use client'

import { createContext } from 'react'

export const ThemeContext = createContext({})

export default function ThemeProvider({ children }) {
  return <ThemeContext.Provider value="dark">{children}</ThemeContext.Provider>
}
```

```jsx filename="app/theme-provider.js" switcher
'use client'

import { createContext } from 'react'

export const ThemeContext = createContext({})

export default function ThemeProvider({ children }) {
  return <ThemeContext.Provider value="dark">{children}</ThemeContext.Provider>
}
```

Your Server Component will now be able to directly render your provider since it's been marked as a Client Component:

```tsx filename="app/layout.tsx" switcher
import ThemeProvider from './theme-provider'

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode
}) {
  return (
    <html>
      <body>
        <ThemeProvider>{children}</ThemeProvider>
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

```jsx filename="app/layout.js" switcher
import ThemeProvider from './theme-provider'

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html>
      <body>
        <ThemeProvider>{children}</ThemeProvider>
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

With the provider rendered at the root, all other Client Components throughout your app will be able to consume this context.

> **Good to know**: You should render providers as deep as possible in the tree â€“ notice how `ThemeProvider` only wraps `{children}` instead of the entire `<html>` document. This makes it easier for Next.js to optimize the static parts of your Server Components.

### Rendering third-party context providers in Server Components

Third-party npm packages often include Providers that need to be rendered near the root of your application. If these providers include the `"use client"` directive, they can be rendered directly inside of your Server Components. However, since Server Components are so new, many third-party providers won't have added the directive yet.

If you try to render a third-party provider that doesn't have `"use client"`, it will cause an error:

```tsx filename="app/layout.tsx" switcher
import { ThemeProvider } from 'acme-theme'

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html>
      <body>
        {/*  Error: `createContext` can't be used in Server Components */}
        <ThemeProvider>{children}</ThemeProvider>
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

```jsx filename="app/layout.js" switcher
import { ThemeProvider } from 'acme-theme'

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html>
      <body>
        {/*  Error: `createContext` can't be used in Server Components */}
        <ThemeProvider>{children}</ThemeProvider>
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

To fix this, wrap third-party providers in your own Client Component:

```jsx filename="app/providers.js"
'use client'

import { ThemeProvider } from 'acme-theme'
import { AuthProvider } from 'acme-auth'

export function Providers({ children }) {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider>
      <AuthProvider>{children}</AuthProvider>
    </ThemeProvider>
  )
}
```

Now, you can import and render `<Providers />` directly within your root layout.

```jsx filename="app/layout.js"
import { Providers } from './providers'

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html>
      <body>
        <Providers>{children}</Providers>
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

With the providers rendered at the root, all the components and hooks from these libraries will work as expected within your own Client Components.

Once a third-party library has added `"use client"` to its client code, you'll be able to remove the wrapper Client Component.

### Sharing data between Server Components

Since Server Components are not interactive and therefore do not read from React state, you don't need React context to share data. Instead, you can use native JavaScript patterns for common data that multiple Server Components need to access. For example, a module can be used to share a database connection across multiple components:

```ts filename="utils/database.ts" switcher
export const db = new DatabaseConnection()
```

```js filename="utils/database.js" switcher
export const db = new DatabaseConnection()
```

```tsx filename="app/users/layout.tsx" switcher
import { db } from '@utils/database'

export async function UsersLayout() {
  let users = await db.query()
  // ...
}
```

```jsx filename="app/users/layout.js" switcher
import { db } from '@utils/database'

export async function UsersLayout() {
  let users = await db.query()
  // ...
}
```

```tsx filename="app/users/[id]/page.tsx" switcher
import { db } from '@utils/database'

export async function DashboardPage() {
  let user = await db.query()
  // ...
}
```

```jsx filename="app/users/[id]/page.js" switcher
import { db } from '@utils/database'

export async function DashboardPage() {
  let user = await db.query()
  // ...
}
```

In the above example, both the layout and page need to make database queries. Each of these components shares access to the database by importing the `@utils/database` module. This JavaScript pattern is called global singletons.

### Sharing fetch requests between Server Components

When fetching data, you may want to share the result of a `fetch` between a `page` or `layout` and some of its children components. This is an unnecessary coupling between the components and can lead to passing `props` back and forth between components.

Instead, we recommend colocating data fetching alongside the component that consumes the data. [`fetch` requests are automatically memoized](/docs/app/building-your-application/caching#request-memoization) in Server Components, so each route segment can request exactly the data it needs without worrying about duplicate requests. Next.js will read the same value from the `fetch` cache.
