React is a JavaScript library that lets you build user interfaces using [components](https://react.dev/learn/your-first-component#components-ui-building-blocks). Traditionally, React components were [rendered](/learn/foundations/how-nextjs-works/rendering) on the client. But in version 18, React introduced components that could be rendered on the server.

To distinguish between components that run on the server or the client, a new naming convention was introduced: **Server Components** and **Client Components**.

In this guide, we'll cover how Server and Client Components work - the easy and the hard parts. Then dive into the details of how to use them in your web applications. We'll start with the fundamentals, assuming no prior knowledge of rendering strategies, and then we'll build up to more advanced topics.
