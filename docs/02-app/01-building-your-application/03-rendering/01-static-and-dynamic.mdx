In Next.js, a route can be statically or dynamically rendered.

## Static Rendering (Default)

By default, Next.js statically renders routes to improve performance. At **build time**, Server and Client components are rendered on the server, and the result of the work is [cached](/docs/app/building-your-application/caching#full-route-cache) and reused on subsequent requests.

> To understand how Client and Server Components are rendered, see the [Rendering Client and Server Components](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-and-client-components) page.

## Dynamic Rendering

With Dynamic Rendering, both Server _and_ Client Components for a route are rendered on the server at **request time**.

During rendering, if a [dynamic function](#dynamic-functions) or uncached data request is discovered, Next.js will switch to dynamically rendering the whole route. This table summarizes how dynamic functions and data caching affect whether a route is statically or dynamically rendered:

| Data       | Dynamic Functions | Route                |
| ---------- | ----------------- | -------------------- |
| Cached     | No                | Statically Rendered  |
| Cached     | Yes               | Dynamically Rendered |
| Not Cached | No                | Dynamic Rendered     |
| Not Cached | Yes               | Dynamic Rendered     |

From the table above, for a route to be fully static, all data must be cached. However, you can have a dynamically rendered route that uses both cached and uncached data fetches. This is useful when you have a page that mostly re-uses cached data, but has some uncached data. It allows you to opt into dynamic rendering without worrying about the performance impact of fetching all the data at request time.

> **Good to know**: In the future, Next.js will introduce hybrid server-side rendering where layouts and pages in a route can be independently statically or dynamically rendered, instead of the whole route.

### Dynamic Functions

Dynamic functions rely on information that can only be known at request time such as a user's cookies, current requests headers, or the URL's search params. In Next.js, these dynamic functions are:

- Using [`cookies()`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/cookies) or [`headers()`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/headers) in a Server Component will opt the whole route into dynamic rendering at request time.
- Using [`useSearchParams()`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-search-params) in Client Components.
  - This will skip static rendering and instead render all Client Components up to the nearest parent Suspense boundary on the client.
  - We recommend wrapping the Client Component that uses `useSearchParams()` in a `<Suspense/>` boundary. This will allow any Client Components above it to be statically rendered. [Example](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-search-params#static-rendering).
- Using the [`searchParams`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/page#searchparams-optional) [Pages](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/page) prop will opt the page into dynamic rendering at request time.
