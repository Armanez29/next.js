description: Learn how Client-side Rendering works and how to use Client Components in Next.js.
---

Client-side Rendering is a strategy for rendering parts of your web application on the client. In Next.js, this is done with [React Client Components](). Client-side rendering is also **opt-in**, meaning you have to explicitly decide what components React should render on the client.

This page will go through how Client Components work, when you might use them, and how Next.js optimizes them.

## React Client Components

React Server Components allow us to create interactive UI that is rendered on the client. There are a couple of benefits to doing the rendering work on the client, including:

- **Interactivity**: Client Components can use state, effects, and event listeners, meaning they can provide immediate feedback to the user and update the UI.
- **Browser APIs**: Client Components have access to browser APIs, like [geolocation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API) or [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage).

## Using Client Components in Next.js

To use Client Components, you can add the React [`"use client"` directive](https://react.dev/reference/react/use-client) at the top of a file, above your imports.

`"use client` is used to declare a boundary between a Server and Client Component module graph. This means
that by defining a `"use client"` in a file, all other modules imported into it, including child components, are considered part of the client bundle - and will be rendered by React on the client.

```tsx filename="app/counter.tsx" highlight={1} switcher
'use client'

import { useState } from 'react'

export default function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

```jsx filename="app/counter.js" highlight={1} switcher
'use client'

import { useState } from 'react'

export default function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

> **Multiple `use client` boundaries**:
>
> You can define multile "use client" boundaries in your React Component tree. This allows you to split your application into multiple bundles (or branches), and only render the components that are needed for a route at runtime.
>
> However, `"use client"` doesn't need to be defined in every component that needs to be rendered on the client. Once you define the boundary, all components and modules imported into it, or in other words, the branch in the tree is considered part of the client bundle.
