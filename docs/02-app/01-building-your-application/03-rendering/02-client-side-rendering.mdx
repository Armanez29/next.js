description: Learn how Client-side Rendering works and how to use Client Components in Next.js.
---

Client-side Rendering is a strategy for rendering parts of your web application on the client. In Next.js, this is done with [React Client Components](). Client-side rendering is also **opt-in**, meaning you have to explicitly decide which parts of your application should be rendered on the client.

This page will go through how Client Components work, when you might use them, and how Next.js optimizes them.

### The "use client" directive

### The "use client" directive

The [`"use client"` directive](https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/pull/227) is a convention to declare a boundary between a Server and Client Component module graph.

```tsx filename="app/counter.tsx" highlight={1} switcher
'use client'

import { useState } from 'react'

export default function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

```jsx filename="app/counter.js" highlight={1} switcher
'use client'

import { useState } from 'react'

export default function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

`"use client"` _sits_ between server-only and client code. It's placed at the top of a file, above imports, to define the _cut-off_ point where it crosses the boundary from the server-only to the client part. Once `"use client"` is defined in a file, all other modules imported into it, including child components, are considered part of the client bundle.

Since Server Components are the default, all components are part of the Server Component module graph unless defined or imported in a module that starts with the `"use client"` directive.

> **Good to know**:
>
> - Components in the Server Component module graph are guaranteed to be only rendered on the server.
> - Components in the Client Component module graph are primarily rendered on the client, but with Next.js, they can also be pre-rendered on the server and hydrated on the client.
> - The `"use client"` directive must be defined at the **top of a file** before any imports.
> - `"use client"` does **not** need to be defined in every file. The Client module boundary only needs to be defined once, at the "entry point", for all modules imported into it to be considered a Client Component.
