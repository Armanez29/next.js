description: Learn the different ways you can style your Next.js application.

Next.js supports various methods for styling your application:

- **Global CSS**: It's simple and familiar for those accustomed to traditional CSS. However, it can result in larger CSS bundles and become challenging to manage as the application scales.
- **CSS Modules**: Create locally scoped CSS classes to prevent naming conflicts and enhance maintainability.
- **Tailwind CSS**: This utility-first CSS framework facilitates rapid custom designs by combining utility classes.
- **Sass**: A widely-used CSS preprocessor that extends CSS with features like variables, nested rules, and mixins.
- **CSS-in-JS**: Embed CSS directly in your JavaScript components, allowing for dynamic and scoped styling.

To learn more about each approach, explore their respective documentation.
