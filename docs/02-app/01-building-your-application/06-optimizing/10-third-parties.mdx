{/* The content of this doc is shared between the app and pages router. You can use the `<PagesOnly>Content</PagesOnly>` component to add content that is specific to the Pages Router. Any shared content should not be wrapped in a component. */}

[**`@next/third-parties`**](/docs/app/api-reference/components/font) is a library that provides a
collection of components and utilities that improve the performance and developer experience of
loading popular third-party libraries in your Next.js application.

> **Good to know**: `@next/third-parties` is a new **experimental** library that is still under
> active development. We're currently working on adding more third-party integrations.

All third-party integrations provided by `@next/third-parties` have been optimized for performance
and ease of use.

## Getting Started

To get started, you must install the `@next/third-parties` library:

```bash filename="Terminal"
npm install @next/third-parties
```

## Google Third-Parties

All supported third-party libraries from Google can be imported from `@next/third-parties/google`.

### Google Maps Embed

The `GoogleMapsEmbed` component can be used to add a Google Maps Embed to your page. By default, it
uses the `loading` attribute to lazy-load the embed below the fold.

<AppOnly>

```jsx filename="app/page.js"
import { GoogleMapsEmbed } from '@next/third-parties/google'

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <GoogleMapsEmbed
      apiKey="XYZ"
      height={200}
      width="100%"
      mapMode="place"
      parameters="q=Brooklyn+Bridge,New+York,NY"
    />
  )
}
```

</AppOnly>

<PagesOnly>

```jsx filename="pages/index.js"
import { GoogleMapsEmbed } from '@next/third-parties/google'

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <GoogleMapsEmbed
      apiKey="XYZ"
      height={200}
      width="100%"
      mapMode="place"
      parameters="q=Brooklyn+Bridge,New+York,NY"
    />
  )
}
```

</PagesOnly>

### YouTube Embed

The `YoutubeEmbed` component can be used to load and display a YouTube embed. This component loads
faster by using [`lite-youtube-embed`](https://github.com/paulirish/lite-youtube-embed) under the
hood.

<AppOnly>

```jsx filename="app/page.js"
import { GoogleMapsEmbed } from '@next/third-parties/google'

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <GoogleMapsEmbed
      apiKey="XYZ"
      height={200}
      width="100%"
      mapMode="place"
      parameters="q=Brooklyn+Bridge,New+York,NY"
    />
  )
}
```

</AppOnly>

<PagesOnly>

```jsx filename="pages/index.js"
import { GoogleMapsEmbed } from '@next/third-parties/google'

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <YoutubeEmbed
      videoid="ogfYd705cRs"
      height={400}
      width="100%"
      mapMode="place"
      parameters="q=Brooklyn+Bridge,New+York,NY"
    />
  )
}
```

</PagesOnly>
