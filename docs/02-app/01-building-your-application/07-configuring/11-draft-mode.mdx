**Draft Mode** allows you to preview draft content from your headless CMS in your Next.js application. This is useful for static pages that are generated at build time, as it allows you to switch to [dynamic rendering](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components#dynamic-rendering) and preview the changes before publishing them.

## Step 1: Create a Route Handler to enable Draft Mode

Create a [Route Handler](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-handlers). It can have any name, e.g. `app/api/draft/route.ts`.

Then, import the [`draftMode`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/draft-mode) function and call the `enable()` method.

```ts filename="app/api/draft/route.ts" switcher
// route handler enabling draft mode
import { draftMode } from 'next/headers'

export async function GET(request: Request) {
  draftMode().enable()
  return new Response('Draft mode is enabled')
}
```

```js filename="app/api/draft/route.js" switcher
// route handler enabling draft mode
import { draftMode } from 'next/headers'

export async function GET(request) {
  draftMode().enable()
  return new Response('Draft mode is enabled')
}
```

This will set a **cookie** to enable draft mode. Subsequent requests containing this cookie will trigger **Draft Mode** changing the behavior for statically generated pages.

You can test this manually by visiting `/api/draft` and looking at your browser’s developer tools. Notice the `Set-Cookie` response header with a cookie named `__prerender_bypass`.

## Step 2: Securely access the Route Handler from your Headless CMS

> These steps assume that the headless CMS you’re using supports setting **custom draft URLs**. If it doesn’t, you can still use this method to secure your draft URLs, but you’ll need to construct and access the draft URL manually.

The specific steps will vary depending on which headless CMS you’re using, but here are some common steps you could take:

1. Create a **secret token string** using a token generator of your choice. This secret will only be known by your Next.js app and your headless CMS.
2. If your headless CMS supports setting custom draft URLs, specify the following as the draft URL (this assumes that your Route Handler is located at `app/api/draft/route.ts`).

```bash filename="Terminal"
https://<your-site>/api/draft?secret=<token>&slug=<path>
```

- `<your-site>` should be your deployment domain.
- `<token>` should be replaced with the secret token you generated.
- `<path>` should be the path for the page that you want to view. If you want to view `/posts/foo`, then you should use `&slug=/posts/foo`.

Your headless CMS might allow you to include a variable in the draft URL so that `<path>` can be set dynamically based on the CMS’s data like so: `&slug=/posts/{entry.fields.slug}`

3. In your Route Handler, check that the secret matches and that the `slug` parameter exists (if not, the request should fail), call `draftMode.enable()` to set the cookie. Then, redirect the browser to the path specified by `slug`:

```ts filename="app/api/draft/route.ts" switcher
import { draftMode } from 'next/headers'
import { redirect } from 'next/navigation'

export async function GET(request: Request) {
  // Parse query string parameters
  const { searchParams } = new URL(request.url)
  const secret = searchParams.get('secret')
  const slug = searchParams.get('slug')

  // Check the secret and next parameters
  // This secret should only be known to this route handler and the CMS
  if (secret !== 'MY_SECRET_TOKEN' || !slug) {
    return new Response('Invalid token', { status: 401 })
  }

  // Fetch the headless CMS to check if the provided `slug` exists
  // getPostBySlug would implement the required fetching logic to the headless CMS
  const post = await getPostBySlug(slug)

  // If the slug doesn't exist prevent draft mode from being enabled
  if (!post) {
    return new Response('Invalid slug', { status: 401 })
  }

  // Enable Draft Mode by setting the cookie
  draftMode().enable()

  // Redirect to the path from the fetched post
  // We don't redirect to searchParams.slug as that might lead to open redirect vulnerabilities
  redirect(post.slug)
}
```

```js filename="app/api/draft/route.js" switcher
import { draftMode } from 'next/headers'
import { redirect } from 'next/navigation'

export async function GET(request) {
  // Parse query string parameters
  const { searchParams } = new URL(request.url)
  const secret = searchParams.get('secret')
  const slug = searchParams.get('slug')

  // Check the secret and next parameters
  // This secret should only be known to this route handler and the CMS
  if (secret !== 'MY_SECRET_TOKEN' || !slug) {
    return new Response('Invalid token', { status: 401 })
  }

  // Fetch the headless CMS to check if the provided `slug` exists
  // getPostBySlug would implement the required fetching logic to the headless CMS
  const post = await getPostBySlug(slug)

  // If the slug doesn't exist prevent draft mode from being enabled
  if (!post) {
    return new Response('Invalid slug', { status: 401 })
  }

  // Enable Draft Mode by setting the cookie
  draftMode().enable()

  // Redirect to the path from the fetched post
  // We don't redirect to searchParams.slug as that might lead to open redirect vulnerabilities
  redirect(post.slug)
}
```

If it succeeds, then the browser will be redirected to the path you want to view with the draft mode cookie.

## Step 3: Update the page

The next step is to update your page to check the value of `draftMode().isEnabled`.

If you request a page which has the cookie set, then data will be fetched at **request time** (instead of at build time).

Furthermore, the value of `isEnabled` will be `true`.

```tsx filename="app/page.tsx" switcher
// page that fetches data
import { draftMode } from 'next/headers'

async function getData() {
  const { isEnabled } = draftMode()

  const url = isEnabled
    ? 'https://draft.example.com'
    : 'https://production.example.com'

  const res = await fetch(url)

  return res.json()
}

export default async function Page() {
  const { title, desc } = await getData()

  return (
    <main>
      <h1>{title}</h1>
      <p>{desc}</p>
    </main>
  )
}
```

```jsx filename="app/page.js" switcher
// page that fetches data
import { draftMode } from 'next/headers'

async function getData() {
  const { isEnabled } = draftMode()

  const url = isEnabled
    ? 'https://draft.example.com'
    : 'https://production.example.com'

  const res = await fetch(url)

  return res.json()
}

export default async function Page() {
  const { title, desc } = await getData()

  return (
    <main>
      <h1>{title}</h1>
      <p>{desc}</p>
    </main>
  )
}
```

That's it! If you access the draft Route Handler (with `secret` and `slug`) from your headless CMS or manually, you should now be able to see the draft content. And, if you update your draft without publishing, you should be able to view the draft.

Set the draft URL on your headless CMS or access manually, and you should be able to see the draft.

```bash filename="Terminal"
https://<your-site>/api/draft?secret=<token>&slug=<path>
```
