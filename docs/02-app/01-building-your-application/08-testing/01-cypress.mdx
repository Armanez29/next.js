description: Learn how to set up Next.js with Cypress - a popular end-to-end and component testing framework.
---

[Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) is a test runner used for **End-to-End (E2E)** and **Component Testing**. This page will show you how to set up Cypress with Next.js and write your first tests.

<AppOnly>

> **Good to know**: We recommend using E2E Testing over Component Testing for **async** React components, as async components are new to the ecosystem and Cypress does not currently support them.

## Quickstart

You can use `create-next-app` with the [with-cypress example](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-cypress) to quickly get started.

```bash filename="Terminal"
npx create-next-app@latest --example with-cypress with-cypress-app
```

</AppOnly>

## Manual setup

To manually set up Cypress, install `cypress` as a dev dependency:

```bash filename="Terminal"
npm install -D cypress
# or
yarn add cypress --dev
# or
pnpm install -D cypress
```

Add the Cypress `open` and `run` commands to the `package.json` scripts field:

```json filename="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start",
    "lint": "next lint",
    "cypress:open": "cypress open",
    "cypress:run": "cypress run"
  }
}
```

Run Cypress for the first time to open the Cypress testing suite:

```bash filename="Terminal"
npm run cypress:open
```

You can choose to configure **E2E Testing** and/or **Component Testing**. Selecting any of these options will automatically create a `cypress.config.js` file and a `cypress` folder in your project.

> **Should I use E2E or Component Tests?**
>
> The [Cypress docs contain a guide](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/testing-types) on the difference between these two types of tests and when it is appropriate to use each.

## Creating your first Cypress E2E test

Ensure your `cypress.config.js` file has the following configuration:

```ts filename="cypress.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from 'cypress'

export default defineConfig({
  e2e: {
    setupNodeEvents(on, config) {},
  },
})
```

```js filename="cypress.config.js"
const { defineConfig } = require('cypress')

module.exports = defineConfig({
  e2e: {
    setupNodeEvents(on, config) {},
  },
})
```

Then, create two new Next.js files:

<AppOnly>

```jsx filename="app/page.js"
import Link from 'next/link'

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <nav>
      <h1>Homepage</h1>
      <Link href="/about">About</Link>
    </nav>
  )
}
```

```jsx filename="app/about/page.js"
import Link from 'next/link'

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>About Page</h1>
      <Link href="/">Homepage</Link>
    </div>
  )
}
```

</AppOnly>

<PagesOnly>

```jsx filename="pages/index.js"
import Link from 'next/link'

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <nav>
      <h1>Homepage</h1>
      <Link href="/about">About</Link>
    </nav>
  )
}
```

```jsx filename="pages/about.js"
import Link from 'next/link'

export default function About() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>About Page</h1>
      <Link href="/">Homepage</Link>
    </div>
  )
}
```

</PagesOnly>

Add a test to check your navigation is working correctly:

```js filename="cypress/e2e/app.cy.js"
describe('Navigation', () => {
  it('should navigate to the about page', () => {
    // Start from the index page
    cy.visit('http://localhost:3000/')

    // Find a link with an href attribute containing "about" and click it
    cy.get('a[href*="about"]').click()

    // The new url should include "/about"
    cy.url().should('include', '/about')

    // The new page should contain an h1 with "About page"
    cy.get('h1').contains('About Page')
  })
})
```

### Running E2E Tests

Since Cypress E2E tests are testing a real Next.js application they require the Next.js server to be running before starting Cypress. We recommend running your tests against your production code to more closely resemble how your application will behave.

Run `npm run build && npm run start` to build your Next.js application, then run `npm run cypress:open` in another terminal window to start Cypress and run your E2E testing suite.

> **Good to know:**
>
> - You can use `cy.visit("/")` instead of `cy.visit("http://localhost:3000/")` by adding `baseUrl: 'http://localhost:3000'` to the `cypress.config.js` configuration file.
> - Alternatively, you can install the `start-server-and-test` package to run the Next.js production server in conjuction with Cypress. After installation, add `"test": "start-server-and-test start http://localhost:3000 cypress"` to your `package.json` scripts field. Remember to rebuild your application after new changes.

## Creating your first Cypress component test

Component tests build and mount a specific component without having to bundle your whole application or launch a server. This allows for more performant tests that still provide visual feedback and the same API used for Cypress E2E tests.

When you select "Component Testing" in the Cypress app, a `cypress/component` folder will be created in your project, and a `cypress.config.js` file will be updated to enable component testing.

Ensure your `cypress.config.js` file has the following configuration:

```ts filename="cypress.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from 'cypress'

export default defineConfig({
  component: {
    devServer: {
      framework: 'next',
      bundler: 'webpack',
    },
  },
})
```

```js filename="cypress.config.js"
const { defineConfig } = require('cypress')

module.exports = defineConfig({
  component: {
    devServer: {
      framework: 'next',
      bundler: 'webpack',
    },
  },
})
```

Assuming the same components from the previous section, add a test to validate a component is rendering the expected output:

```jsx filename="cypress/about.cy.js"
import AboutPage from './about.js'

describe('<AboutPage />', () => {
  it('should render and display expected content', () => {
    // Mount the React component for the About page
    cy.mount(<AboutPage />)

    // The new page should contain an h1 with "About page"
    cy.get('h1').contains('About Page')

    // Validate that a link with the expected URL is present
    // *Following* the link is better suited to an E2E test
    cy.get('a[href="/"]').should('be.visible')
  })
})
```

> **Good to know**: Since component tests do not launch a Next.js server, capabilities like `<Image />` <PagesOnly>and `getServerSideProps`</PagesOnly> which rely on a server being available will not function out-of-the-box. See the [Cypress Next.js docs](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/component-testing/react/overview#Nextjs) for examples of getting these features working within component tests.

### Running Component Tests

run `npm run cypress:open` in your terminal to start Cypress and run your component testing suite.

## Continuous Integration (CI)

You will have noticed that running Cypress so far has opened an interactive browser which is not ideal for CI environments. You can also run Cypress headlessly using the `cypress run` command:

```json filename="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    //...
    "e2e": "start-server-and-test dev http://localhost:3000 \"cypress open --e2e\"",
    "e2e:headless": "start-server-and-test dev http://localhost:3000 \"cypress run --e2e\"",
    "component": "cypress open --component",
    "component:headless": "cypress run --component"
  }
}
```
