Playwright is a testing framework that lets you automate Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit with a single API. You can use it to write **End-to-End (E2E)** and **Integration** tests across all platforms.

## Quickstart

The fastest way to get started is to use `create-next-app` with the [with-playwright example](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-playwright). This will create a Next.js project complete with Playwright configured.

```bash filename="Terminal"
npx create-next-app@latest --example with-playwright with-playwright-app
```

## Manual setup

To install Playwright, run the following command:

```bash filename="Terminal"
npm init playwright
# or
yarn create playwright
# or
pnpm create playwright
```

This will take you through a series of prompts to configure Playwright for your project. Please refer to the [Playwright installation guide](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro#installation) for the step-by-step guide.

## Creating your first Playwright E2E test

Create two new Next.js pages:

<AppOnly>

```tsx filename="app/page.tsx"
import Link from 'next/link'

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Home Page</h1>
      <Link href="/about">About</Link>
    </div>
  )
}
```

```tsx filename="app/about/page.tsx"
import Link from 'next/link'

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>About Page</h1>
      <Link href="/">Home</Link>
    </div>
  )
}
```

<PagesOnly>

```tsx filename="pages/index.ts"
import Link from 'next/link'

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Home Page</h1>
      <Link href="/about">About</Link>
    </div>
  )
}
```

```tsx filename="pages/about.ts"
import Link from 'next/link'

export default function About() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>About Page</h1>
      <Link href="/">Home</Link>
    </div>
  )
}
```

</PagesOnly>

Then, add a test to verify that your navigation is working correctly:

```ts filename="tests/example.spec.ts"
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test'

test('should navigate to the about page', async ({ page }) => {
  // Start from the index page (the baseURL is set via the webServer in the playwright.config.ts)
  await page.goto('http://localhost:3000/')
  // Find an element with the text 'About Page' and click on it
  await page.click('text=About')
  // The new URL should be "/about" (baseURL is used there)
  await expect(page).toHaveURL('http://localhost:3000/about')
  // The new page should contain an h1 with "About Page"
  await expect(page.locator('h1')).toContainText('About')
})
```

> **Good to know**:
>
> You can use `page.goto("/")` instead of `page.goto("http://localhost:3000/")`, if you add [`"baseURL": "http://localhost:3000"`](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testoptions#test-options-base-url) to the `playwright.config.ts` [configuration file](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-configuration).

### Running your Playwright tests

Since Playwright is testing a real Next.js application, it requires the Next.js server to be running prior to starting Playwright. It is recommended to run your tests against your production code to more closely resemble how your application will behave.

Run `npm run build` and `npm run start`, then run `npm run test:e2e` in another terminal window to run the Playwright tests.

> **Good to know**: Alternatively, you can use the [`webServer`](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-webserver/) feature to let Playwright start the development server and wait until it's fully available.

### Running Playwright on Continuous Integration (CI)

Playwright will by default run your tests in the [headless mode](https://playwright.dev/docs/ci#running-headed). To install all the Playwright dependencies, run `npx playwright install-deps`.
