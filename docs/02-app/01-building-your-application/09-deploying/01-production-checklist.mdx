title: Going to Production
description: Before taking your Next.js application to production, here are some recommendations to ensure the best user experience.
---

{/* TODO: better intro */}

This page provides a checklist of recommended Next.js features, best practices, and patterns, you can use to improve your application’s performance and user experience before going to production. Use it as a reference during [development](#during-development), [before going to production](#before-going-to-production), and after your application has been [deployed](#after-deployment).

## Automatic Optimizations

Out-of-box, Next.js provides these automatic optimizations which you do not need to configure:

- Automatic [code-splitting](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/linking-and-navigating#how-routing-and-navigation-works) of route segments. {/* TODO: This needs a better link */}
- [Static Rendering](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components#static-rendering-default) by default, with [Dynamic Rendering](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components#dynamic-rendering) as opt-in.
- Pre-rendering React components to HTML on the server for improved SEO and initial loading performance. {/* TODO: Add link */}

## During Development

### Routing

- Use [layouts](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts#layouts) to share UI across pages and enable [partial rendering](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/linking-and-navigating#3-partial-rendering) on navigation.
- Use the [`<Link>` component](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/linking-and-navigating#link-component) for [client-side navigation and prefetching](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/linking-and-navigating#how-routing-and-navigation-works).
- [Handle catch-all errors](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/error-handling) and [404 errors](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/not-found) gracefully.

### Data Fetching and Caching

- [Fetch data on the server](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/patterns#fetching-data-on-the-server) where possible.
- Use [Loading UI and Suspense](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/loading-ui-and-streaming) to prevent the page from blocking while data is being fetched.
- Reduce network waterfalls by [fetching data in parallel](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/patterns#parallel-and-sequential-data-fetching), where appropriate.
- [Cache data requests](/docs/app/building-your-application/caching#data-cache), where appropriate.
- Mutate data using [Server Actions](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/server-actions-and-mutations) or [Route Handlers](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-handlers).

### Security

- Prevent sensitive data from being exposed to the client with [tainting](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/patterns#preventing-sensitive-data-from-being-exposed-to-the-client).
- Ensure users are authorized to call [Server Actions](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/server-actions-and-mutations#authorization), and follow the recommended [security practices](/blog/security-nextjs-server-components-actions).
- Consider adding a [Content Security Policy](/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/content-security-policy)

### Rendering

- Use [Server Components](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components) when possible to reduce the size of your client-side JavaScript bundle.
- Follow the recommended [composition patterns](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/composition-patterns) for Server and Client Components.
- [Lazy load](/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/lazy-loading) Client Components and third-party libraries, where appropriate.

### Optimizations

- Optimize fonts with the [next/font](/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts)
- Optimize images with [next/image](/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/images)
- Optimize scripts with [next/script](/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/scripts)

### Static assets

- Use the [public directory](/docs/app/api-reference/next.config.js/static-asset-optimization) to automatically cache static assets like images.

### Type Safety

- Use the [TypeScript IDE plugin](/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/typescript) for better type-safety, and to help you catch errors early.

### Accessibility

- [Validate form fields and handle errors](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/server-actions-and-mutations#server-side-validation-and-error-handling) appropriately.
- Use [ESlint](/docs/architecture/accessibility) to catch accessibility issues early.

### Metadata

- Use the [Metadata API](/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/metadata) to improve SEO by adding page titles, descriptions, and more.
- Create [OG images](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/metadata/opengraph-image) for social sharing.
- Help Search Engines crawl and index your pages with [sitemaps](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/metadata/sitemap).

## Before going to production

Before going to production, you can run `next build` to build your application locally and catch any build errors, then run `next start` to measure the performance of your application in a production-like environment.

### Core Web Vitals

- Run [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) in incognito to understand how your users will experience your site, and to identify areas for improvement.
- Use the [`useReportWebVitals` hook](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-report-web-vitals) to send [Core Web Vitals](https://web.dev/articles/vitals) data to analytics tools.

### Environment Variables

{/* TO DO */}

### Analyzing Bundles

You can use the [`@next/bundle-analyzer` plugin](/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/bundle-analyzer) to analyze the size of your JavaScript bundles and identify large dependencies that might be impacting your application's performance.

Additionally, the following tools can help you visualize your client-side JavaScript bundles:

{/* TODO: Review this, and reduce the number of tools */}

- [Import Cost](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wix.vscode-import-cost) – Shows the size of each package you import right in VSCode.
- [Package Phobia](https://packagephobia.com/) – Helps you see the size impact of adding new dev dependencies to your project.
- [Bundle Phobia](https://bundlephobia.com/) - Tells you how much a new dependency could increase your JavaScript size.
- [Webpack Bundle Analyzer](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/next-bundle-analyzer) – Creates a visual, interactive map of your webpack output files to show where space is used.
- [bundlejs](https://bundlejs.com/) - A browser tool for bundling and minifying projects, showing compressed sizes.

### Databases

- Ensure your application and database are deployed in the same region to reduce [latency](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/Understanding_latency).
- Use [caching](/docs/app/building-your-application/caching#data-cache) to reduce the number of network requests to your database.

## After deployment

Depending on where you deploy your application, you might have access to additional tools and integrations to help you monitor and improve your application's performance:

### Monitoring, Logging, and Observability (Vercel deployments)

- Ensure these are setup up to help you debug issues in production. See Vercel's integrations page for a list of available [logging](https://vercel.com/integrations#logging), [monitoring](https://vercel.com/integrations#monitoring), and [observability](https://vercel.com/integrations#observability) tools.

### Analytics (Vercel deployments)

- Use [Vercel's built-in analytics dashboard](https://vercel.com/analytics) to measure Core Web Vitals. This dashboard provides real-world performance insights based on actual visitor data, offering a practical view of how your website is performing in the field.

> **Good to know:** To get a comprehensive understanding of the best practices for production deployments on Vercel, including detailed strategies for improving website performance, refer to the [Vercel Production Checklist](https://vercel.com/docs/production-checklist).

{/* TODO: Conclude */}

Following these recommendations will help you build a fast, reliable, and accessible application.
