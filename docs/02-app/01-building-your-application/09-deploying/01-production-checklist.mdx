description: Recommendations to ensure the best performance and user experience before taking your Next.js application to production.
---

Before taking your application to production, there are patterns and optimizations you need to consider to ensure the best performance, user experience, and security. This page provides a checklist of best practices that you can use as a reference during [development](#during-development), [before going to production](#before-going-to-production), and [after deployment](#after-deployment), as well as the [automatic Next.js optimizations](#automatic-optimizations) you should be aware of.

## Automatic Optimizations

These Next.js optimizations are enabled by default and require no configuration:

- [**Server Components:**](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components) Next.js uses React Server Components by default. Server Components execute on the server, and don't require JavaScript to render on the client. As such, they have no impact on your JavaScript bundle size. You can opt into using [Client Components](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/client-components) when needed. For instance, to add client-side interactivity.
- [**Code Splitting:**](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/linking-and-navigating#how-routing-and-navigation-works) Server Components enable automatic code-splitting by route segments. Unlike a traditional [SPA](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/SPA), only the code needed for a route is loaded on navigation. While you don't need to do any code-splitting, you may still wish to [lazy load](/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/lazy-loading) Client Components and third-party libraries, where appropriate.
- [**Static Rendering:**](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components#static-rendering-default) Next.js statically renders Server and Client Components on the server to improve your application's initial loading performance. You can opt into [Dynamic Rendering](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components#dynamic-rendering) for specific components, where appropriate. {/* TODO: Update to say PPR in the future */}
- [**Caching:**](/docs/app/building-your-application/caching): Next.js caches data requests, the rendering result of Server and Client Components, static assets, and more, to reduce the number of network requests to your database and backend services. You may opt out of caching, where appropriate.

These defaults aim to improve your application's performance and reduce the amount of data transferred on each network request.

## During Development

While building your application, we recommend using the following features to ensure the best performance and user experience:

### Routing and Rendering

- [**Layouts:**](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts#layouts) Use them to share UI across pages and enable [partial rendering](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/linking-and-navigating#4-partial-rendering) on navigation.
- [**`<Link>` component:**](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/linking-and-navigating#link-component) Use the `<Link>` component for [client-side navigation and prefetching](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/linking-and-navigating#how-routing-and-navigation-works). This means no full page refresh when navigating between pages, and Next.js will prefetch the code for the next page in the background - making navigation to new routes almost instant.
- [**Error Handling:**](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/error-handling) Gracefully handle [catch-all errors](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/error-handling) and [404 errors](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/not-found) in production by creating custom error pages.
- [**Composition Patterns:**](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/composition-patterns) Follow the recommended composition patterns for Server and Client Components, and check the placement of your [`"use client"` boundaries](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/composition-patterns#moving-client-components-down-the-tree) to avoid unnecessarily increasing your JavaScript bundle size.
- [**Dynamic Functions:**](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components#dynamic-functions) Verify if your application contains dynamic functions such as [cookies](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/cookies) and [useSearchParams](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-search-params). Since these functions rely on runtime information, using them will opt a route into [Dynamic Rendering](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components#dynamic-rendering), or your whole application if used in the [Root Layout](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts#root-layout-required). Unless your application is meant to be fully dynamic, move these functions down your component tree and wrap them in `<Suspense>` to prevent your route from blocking. {/* TODO: Update this bullet point when PPR is available */}

### Data Fetching and Caching

- [**Server Components and Route Handlers:**](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/patterns#fetching-data-on-the-server) Leverage the benefits of fetching data on the server using Server Components, or use [Route Handlers](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-handlers) to fetch data on the Server from Client Components.
- [**Streaming:**](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/loading-ui-and-streaming) Use Loading UI and React Suspense to prevent the whole route from blocking while data is being fetched.
- [**Parallel Data Fetching:**](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/patterns#parallel-and-sequential-data-fetching) Reduce network waterfalls by fetching data in parallel, where appropriate.
- [**Data Caching:**](/docs/app/building-your-application/caching#data-cache) Verify whether your data requests are being cached or not, and opt into caching, where appropriate.
- [**Static Assets:**](/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/static-assets) For smaller applications, use the `public` directory to automatically cache static assets like images.

### UI and Accessibility

- [**Font Module:**](/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) Optimize fonts by using the Font Module, which automatically hosts your font files with other static assets, and prevent additional network requests at runtime.
- [**`<Image>` Component:**](/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/images) Optimize images by using the Image Component, which automatically optimizes images and serves them in modern formats like WebP.
- [**`Script` Component:**](/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/scripts) Optimize third-party scripts by using the Script Component, which automatically defers scripts and prevents them from blocking the main thread.
- [**Forms and Validation:**](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/server-actions-and-mutations#forms) Use Server Actions to handle form submissions, server-side validation, and error handling.
- [**ESLint:**](/docs/architecture/accessibility#linting) Use the built-in `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y` plugin to catch accessibility issues early.

### Security

- [**Tainting:**](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/patterns#preventing-sensitive-data-from-being-exposed-to-the-client) Prevent sensitive data from being exposed to the client by tainting your data objects.
- [**Server Actions:**](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/server-actions-and-mutations#authentication-and-authorization) Ensure users are authorized to call Server Actions, and follow the recommended [security practices](/blog/security-nextjs-server-components-actions).
- [**Content Security Policy:**](/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/content-security-policy) Consider adding a Content Security Policy to protect your application against various security threats such as cross-site scripting, clickjacking, and other code injection attacks.

### Metadata

- [**Metadata API:**](/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/metadata) Improve your application's SEO by adding page titles, descriptions, and more.
- [**OG images:**](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/metadata/opengraph-image) Create OG images to prepare your application for social sharing.
- **[Sitemaps](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-sitemaps) and [Robots](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/metadata/robots):** Help Search Engines crawl and index your pages by generating sitemaps and creating a robots.txt file.

### Type Safety

- [**TS Plugin:**](/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/typescript) Use the TypeScript for better type-safety, and to help you catch errors early.

## Before going to production

Before going to production, you can run `next build` to build your application locally and catch any build errors, then run `next start` to measure the performance of your application in a production-like environment.

### Core Web Vitals

- Run [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) in incognito to understand how your users will experience your site, and to identify areas for improvement.
- Use the [`useReportWebVitals` hook](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-report-web-vitals) to send [Core Web Vitals](https://web.dev/articles/vitals) data to analytics tools.

### Environment Variables

{/* TO DO */}

### Analyzing Bundles

You can use the [`@next/bundle-analyzer` plugin](/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/bundle-analyzer) to analyze the size of your JavaScript bundles and identify large dependencies that might be impacting your application's performance.

Additionally, the following tools can help you visualize your client-side JavaScript bundles:

{/* TODO: Review this, and reduce the number of tools */}

- [Import Cost](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wix.vscode-import-cost) – Shows the size of each package you import right in VSCode.
- [Package Phobia](https://packagephobia.com/) – Helps you see the size impact of adding new dev dependencies to your project.
- [Bundle Phobia](https://bundlephobia.com/) - Tells you how much a new dependency could increase your JavaScript size.
- [Webpack Bundle Analyzer](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/next-bundle-analyzer) – Creates a visual, interactive map of your webpack output files to show where space is used.
- [bundlejs](https://bundlejs.com/) - A browser tool for bundling and minifying projects, showing compressed sizes.

### Databases

- Ensure your application and database are deployed in the same region to reduce [latency](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/Understanding_latency).
- Use [caching](/docs/app/building-your-application/caching#data-cache) to reduce the number of network requests to your database.

## After deployment

Depending on where you deploy your application, you might have access to additional tools and integrations to help you monitor and improve your application's performance:

### Monitoring, Logging, and Observability (Vercel deployments)

- Ensure these are setup up to help you debug issues in production. See Vercel's integrations page for a list of available [logging](https://vercel.com/integrations#logging), [monitoring](https://vercel.com/integrations#monitoring), and [observability](https://vercel.com/integrations#observability) tools.

### Analytics (Vercel deployments)

- Use [Vercel's built-in analytics dashboard](https://vercel.com/analytics) to measure Core Web Vitals. This dashboard provides real-world performance insights based on actual visitor data, offering a practical view of how your website is performing in the field.
