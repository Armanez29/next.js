Multi Zones are an approach to micro-frontends that separate a single large application on a domain into smaller applications that each serve a set of paths. This is useful when there are collections of pages unrelated to the other pages in the application. By moving those pages to a separate zone, you can reduce the size of each application which improves build times and removes code that is only necessary for one of the zones.

For example, let's say you have the following set of pages that you would like to split up:

- `/blog/*` for all blog posts
- `/docs/*` for all documentation
- The rest of your website

With multi zones support, you can create three applications that all are served on the same domain and look the same to the user, but you can develop and deploy each of the applications independently.

> **Good to know**: When a user navigates from a page in one zone to a page in another zone, they will need to unload the current page and load the resources from the new page. Pages that are frequently visited together should usually live in the same zone.

## How to define a zone

There are no special APIs to define a new zone. A zone is a normal Next.js application where you also configure a [basePath](/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/basePath) to avoid conflicts with pages and static files.

```js filename="next.config.js"
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  basePath: '/blog',
}
```

The default application that will handle all paths not sent to a more specific zone does not need a `basePath`.

## How to route requests to the right zone

With the Multi Zones set-up, you need to route the paths to the correct zone since they are served by different applications. You can use any HTTP proxy to do this, but typically one of the Next.js applications is chosen to be the routing application.

To route to the correct zone using a Next.js application, you can use [`rewrites`](/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/rewrites). For each path served by a different zone, you would add a rewrite rule to send that path to the domain of the other zone. For example:

```js filename="next.config.js"
async rewrites() {
    return [
        {
            source: '/blog',
            destination: `${process.env.BLOG_DOMAIN}/blog`,
        },
        {
            source: '/blog/:path+',
            destination: `${process.env.BLOG_DOMAIN}/blog/:path+`,
        }
    ];
}
```

> **Good to know**: URL paths should be unique to a zone. For example, if this zone serves `/blog`, no other zone should also try to serve `/blog`.

## Linking between zones

Links to paths in a different zone should use an `a` tag to link to those zones. Next.js will try to prefetch and soft navigate to any relative path used in a [`Link`](/docs/pages/api-reference/components/link) component, even if the path lives in a different zone.

## Sharing code

The Next.js applications that make up the different zones can live in any repository. However, it is often convenient to put these zones in a monorepo to more easily share code. For zones that live in different repositories, code can also be shared using public or private NPM packages.

Since the pages in different zones may be released at different times, feature flags can be useful for enabling or disabling features in unison across the different zones.

For [Next.js on Vercel](https://vercel.com?utm_source=next-site&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=next-website) applications, you can use a [monorepo](https://vercel.com/blog/monorepos-are-changing-how-teams-build-software?utm_source=next-site&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=next-website) to deploy all affected zones with a single `git push`.
