The `middleware.js|ts` file is used to write [Middleware](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware) and run code on the server before a request is completed. Then, based on the incoming request, you can modify the response by rewriting, redirecting, modifying the request or response headers, or responding directly.

Middleware executes before routes are rendered. It's particularly useful for implementing custom server-side logic like authentication, logging, or handling redirects.

Use the file `middleware.ts` (or .js) in the root of your project to define Middleware. For example, at the same level as `app` or `pages`, or inside `src` if applicable.

```tsx filename="middleware.ts" switcher
import { NextResponse, NextRequest } from 'next/server'

// This function can be marked `async` if using `await` inside
export function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
  return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/home', request.url))
}

export const config = {
  matcher: '/about/:path*',
}
```

```js filename="middleware.js" switcher
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

// This function can be marked `async` if using `await` inside
export function middleware(request) {
  return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/home', request.url))
}

export const config = {
  matcher: '/about/:path*',
}
```

## Exports

### Middleware function

The file must export a single function, either as a default export or named `middleware`. Note that multiple middleware from the same file are not supported.

```js filename="middleware.js"
// Example of default export
export default function middleware(request) {
  // Middleware logic
}
```

### Config object (optional)

Optionally, a config object can be exported alongside the Middleware function. This object includes the [matcher](#matcher) to specify paths where the Middleware applies.

#### Matcher

[`matcher`](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware#matcher) is a feature in Middleware that allows you to target specific paths for the Middleware to operate on. You can specify these paths in several ways:

- For a single path: Directly use a string to define the path, like `'/about'`.
- For multiple paths: Use an array to list multiple paths, such as `matcher: ['/about', '/contact']`, which applies the Middleware to both `/about` and `/contact`.

Additionally, `matcher` supports complex path specifications through regular expressions, enabling precise control over which paths to include or exclude.

Within the `matcher`, there are two key components:

- **`source`**: This defines the paths or patterns to match. It's essentially a set of rules that the Middleware uses to determine which paths to act on. For instance, you can create a pattern in `source` to exclude paths beginning with 'api' or '\_next/static', focusing the Middleware's operation on other specified paths.
- **`missing`**: This specifies conditions based on the absence of certain elements in the request. It allows you to run the Middleware only when specific criteria, like missing headers or query parameters, are met. It's a way to ensure that the Middleware activates only in certain scenarios, adding an extra layer of control.

```js filename="middleware.js"
export const config = {
  matcher: [
    /*
     * Match all request paths except for the ones starting with:
     * - api (API routes)
     * - _next/static (static files)
     * - _next/image (image optimization files)
     * - favicon.ico (favicon file)
     */
    {
      source: '/((?!api|_next/static|_next/image|favicon.ico).*)',
      missing: [
        { type: 'header', key: 'next-router-prefetch' },
        { type: 'header', key: 'purpose', value: 'prefetch' },
      ],
    },
  ],
}
```

## Params

### `request`

When defining Middleware, the default export function accepts a single parameter, `request`. This parameter is an instance of `NextRequest`, which represents the incoming HTTP request.

```tsx filename="middleware.ts" switcher
import type { NextRequest } from 'next/server'

export function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
  // Middleware logic goes here
}
```

```js filename="middleware.js" switcher
export function middleware(request) {
  // Middleware logic goes here
}
```

> **Good to know**:
>
> - `NextRequest` is a type that represents incoming HTTP requests in Next.js Middleware, whereas [`NextResponse`](#nextresponse) is a class used to manipulate and send back HTTP responses.

## NextResponse

Middleware can use the [`NextResponse`](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware#nextresponse) object which extends the [Web Response API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response). By returning a `NextResponse` object, you can directly manipulate cookies, set headers, implement redirects, and rewrite paths.

> **Good to know**: For redirects, you can also use `Response.redirect` instead of `NextResponse.redirect`.

## Runtime

Middleware only supports the [Edge runtime](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/edge-and-nodejs-runtimes). The Node.js runtime cannot be used.
