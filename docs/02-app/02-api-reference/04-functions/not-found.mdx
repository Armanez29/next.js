title: notFound
description: API Reference for the notFound function.
---

The `notFound` function allows you to render the [`not-found file`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/not-found) within a route segment as well as inject a `<meta name="robots" content="noindex" />` tag.

## How It Works

Invoking the `notFound()` function throws a `NEXT_NOT_FOUND` error and terminates rendering of the route segment in which it was thrown. Specifying a [**not-found** file](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/not-found) allows you to gracefully handle such errors by rendering a Not Found UI within the segment.

> **Good to know**: `notFound()` does not require you to use `return notFound()` due to using the TypeScript [`never`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/functions.html#never) type.

### In Route Handlers

When the `NEXT_NOT_FOUND` error is thrown, the Next.js server will catch it and generate a normal 404 HTTP response to the client.

### In Components

When the `NEXT_NOT_FOUND` error is thrown, Next.js will catch it in a special error boundary, where the router will display the `not-found` file (if present) or a default Not Found UI.

```jsx filename="app/user/[id]/page.js"
import { notFound } from 'next/navigation'

async function fetchUser(id) {
  const res = await fetch('https://...')
  if (!res.ok) return undefined
  return res.json()
}

export default async function Profile({ params }) {
  const user = await fetchUser(params.id)

  if (!user) {
    notFound()
  }

  // ...
}
```

### Behaviour in Client Components

Note that, because `NEXT_NOT_FOUND` has to trigger the special error boundary for the Not Found UI to be displayed, `notFound` can only work if you call it during the rendering step. It does not work in places like event handlers or `useEffect`, because in React, errors there do not trigger the error boundary.

```jsx filename="components/handle-auth.js"
'use client'

import { notFound } from 'next/navigation'
import { useState } from 'react'

export default function HandleAuth() {
  const [isAuthenticated, setIsAuthenticated] = useState(true)
  // notFound is called when the component is rendered, so it works fine here
  if (!isAuthenticated) notFound()
  return (
    <button
      onClick={() => {
        setIsAuthenticated(false)
      }}
    >
      Log out
    </button>
  )
}
```
