description: Next.js provides gzip compression to compress rendered content and static files, it only works with the server target. Learn more about it here.

By default, Next.js compresses rendered content and static files when using `next start` or a custom server using `gzip` (default). If compression is already configured in your application via a custom server, Next.js will not add its own compressor.

> **Good to know:**
>
> - When hosting your application on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/compression), compression uses `brotli` **and** `gzip`.
> - You can check if compression is enabled and which algorithm is used by looking at the [`Accept-Encoding`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept-Encoding) (browser accepted options) and [`Content-Encoding`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Encoding) (currently used) headers in the response.

## Disabling compression

To disable **compression**, set the `compress` config option to `false`:

```js filename="next.config.js"
module.exports = {
  compress: false,
}
```

We do not recommend disabling compression unless you have a specific reason to do so, as compression reduces bandwidth usage and improves the performance of your application.
