title: cssChunking (Experimental)
description: Use the `cssChunking` option to control how CSS files are chunked in your Next.js application.

CSS Chunking is a strategy used to improve the performance of your web application by splitting and re-ordering CSS files into chunks. This allows you to load only the CSS that is needed for a specific route, instead of loading all the application's CSS at once.

You can control how CSS files are chunked using the `experimental.cssChunking` option in your `next.config.js` file:

```tsx filename="next.config.ts" switcher
import type { NextConfig } from 'next'

const nextConfig = {
  experimental: {
    cssChunking: 'loose', // default
  },
} satisfies NextConfig

export default nextConfig
```

```js filename="next.config.js" switcher
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  experimental: {
    cssChunking: ['loose'], // default
  },
}

module.exports = nextConfig
```

## Options

- **`'loose'` (default)**: Next.js will try to merge CSS files whenever possible, guessing the dependencies between files to reduce the number of chunks and therefore the number of requests.
- **`'strict'`**: Next.js will merge CSS files in the correct order they are imported into your application, which can lead to more chunks and requests.

You may consider using `'strict'` if you run into CSS issues where the order of CSS files is important. However, we recommend using `'loose'` for most applications, as it leads to fewer requests and better performance.
