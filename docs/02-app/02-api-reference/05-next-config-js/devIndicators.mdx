<AppOnly>

`devIndicators` is a `next.config.js` option that allows you to configure the on-screen indicators that help you understand what's happening to your application during development mode.

```ts filename="Types"
  devIndicators: {
    appIsrStatus?: boolean, // default is true
    buildActivity?: boolean, // default is true
    buildActivityPosition?: 'bottom-right'
    | 'bottom-left'
    | 'top-right'
    | 'top-left', // default is 'bottom-right'
  },
```

## `appIsrStatus` (Static Indicator)

Next.js displays a static indicator in the bottom-left corner of the screen to signal if a route will be prerendered at build time. This makes it easier to understand whether a route is static or dynamic, and for you to identify if a route [silently opt-outs of static rendering](#static-route not-showing-the-indicator).

{/* TODO: Add screenshot - waiting for design */}

You can hide the indicator by closing it, or disable it for your whole application in `next.config.js`:

```ts filename="next.config.ts" switcher
import type { NextConfig } from 'next'

const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
  devIndicators: {
    appIsrStatus: false,
  },
}
```

```js filename="next.config.js" switcher
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */

const nextConfig = {
  devIndicators: {
    appIsrStatus: false,
  },
}

module.exports = nextConfig
```

{/* TODO: Review this section */}

## `buildActivity` (Compilation Indicator)

When you edit your code, and Next.js is compiling the application, a compilation indicator appears in the bottom right corner of the page.

> **Good to know**: This indicator is only present in development mode and will not appear when building and running the app in production mode.

In some cases this indicator can be misplaced on your page, for example, when conflicting with a chat launcher. To change its position, open `next.config.js` and set the `buildActivityPosition` in the `devIndicators` object to `bottom-right` (default), `bottom-left`, `top-right` or `top-left`:

```js filename="next.config.js"
module.exports = {
  devIndicators: {
    buildActivityPosition: 'bottom-right',
  },
}
```

In some cases this indicator might not be useful for you. To remove it, open `next.config.js` and disable the `buildActivity` config in `devIndicators` object:

```js filename="next.config.js"
module.exports = {
  devIndicators: {
    buildActivity: false,
  },
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Static route not showing the indicator

TODO: need better title, but tldr what to do if there's a silent static opt-out

<PagesOnly>

> **Good to know**: This indicator was removed in Next.js version 10.0.1. We recommend upgrading to the latest version of Next.js.

When a page qualifies for [Automatic Static Optimization](/docs/pages/building-your-application/rendering/automatic-static-optimization) we show an indicator to let you know.

This is helpful since automatic static optimization can be very beneficial and knowing immediately in development if the page qualifies can be useful.

In some cases this indicator might not be useful, like when working on electron applications. To remove it open `next.config.js` and disable the `autoPrerender` config in `devIndicators`:

```js filename="next.config.js"
module.exports = {
  devIndicators: {
    autoPrerender: false,
  },
}
```
