You can specify a custom `stale-while-revalidate` expire time for CDNs to consume in the `Cache-Control` header for ISR enabled pages.

Open `next.config.js` and add the `expireTime` config:

```js filename="next.config.js"
module.exports = {
  // one year in seconds
  expireTime: 31536000,
}
```

Now when sending the `Cache-Control` header the expire time will be calculated depending on the specific revalidate period.

For example, if you have a revalidate of 30 seconds on a path and the expire time is 31536000 seconds the generated `Cache-Control` header will be `s-maxage=30, stale-while-revalidate=31535970` so that it can stay stale for 30 seconds less than the configured expire time.
