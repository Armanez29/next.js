description: Configure how data fetches are logged to the console when running Next.js in development mode.

{/* The content of this doc is shared between the app and pages router. You can use the `<PagesOnly>Content</PagesOnly>` component to add content that is specific to the Pages Router. Any shared content should not be wrapped in a component. */}

You can configure the logging level and whether the full URL is logged to the console when running Next.js in development mode.

Currently, `logging` only applies to data fetching using the `fetch` API. It does not yet apply to other logs inside of Next.js.

```js filename="next.config.mjs"
const nextConfig = {
  logging: {
    fetches: {
      fullUrl: true,
    },
  },
}

export default nextConfig
```

In addition, you can disable the route-level logging by setting `logging` to `false`.

```
GET / in ...ms
GET / in ...ms
GET / in ...ms
GET / in ...ms
```

```js filename="next.config.mjs"
const nextConfig = {
  logging: false,
}

export default nextConfig
```
