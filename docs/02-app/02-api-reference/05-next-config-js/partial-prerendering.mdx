Partial Prerendering allows static portions of a route to be prerendered and served from the cache with dynamic holes streamed in, all in a single HTTP request.

You can enable Partial Prerendering by setting the experimental `ppr` flag:

```js filename="next.config.js"
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  experimental: {
    ppr: true,
  },
}

module.exports = nextConfig
```
