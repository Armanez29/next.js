description: Learn how to enable Partial Prerendering (experimental) in Next.js 14.

> **Warning**: Partial Prerendering is an experimental feature and is currently **not suitable for production environments**.  Partial Prerendering is incompatible with the [Edge Runtime](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/edge-and-nodejs-runtimes).
Partial Prerendering is an experimental feature that allows static portions of a route to be prerendered and served from the cache with dynamic holes streamed in, all in a single HTTP request.

Partial Prerendering is available in the latest canary build. You can enable Partial Prerendering by setting the experimental `ppr` flag:

```js filename="next.config.js"
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  experimental: {
    ppr: true,
  },
}

module.exports = nextConfig
```
