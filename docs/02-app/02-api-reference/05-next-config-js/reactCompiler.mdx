title: reactCompiler (Experimental)
description: Enable the React Compiler to automatically optimize component rendering.
---

> This feature is **experimental** and may change in future releases.

Next.js 15 introduced experimental support for the [React Compiler](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler). The compiler improves performance by automatically optimizing component rendering. This reduces the amount of manual memoization developers have to do through APIs such as `useMemo` and `useCallback`.

To use it, upgrade to Next.js 15, install the `babel-plugin-react-compiler`, and add `experimental.reactCompiler` to your `next.config.js`:

```bash filename="Terminal"
npm install next@canary babel-plugin-react-compiler
```

```js filename="next.config.js"
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  experimental: {
    reactCompiler: true,
  },
}

module.exports = nextConfig
```

Alternatively, you can pass a configuration object. See the [React Compiler](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler) to learn more.
