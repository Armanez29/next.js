description: Use the `resolveExtensions` option to define the list and order of extensions that Webpack and Turbopack will attempt to resolve.
version: experimental

{/* The content of this doc is shared between the app and pages router. You can use the `<PagesOnly>Content</PagesOnly>` component to add content that is specific to the Pages Router. Any shared content should not be wrapped in a component. */}

Through `experimental.resolveExtensions`, Turbopack and Webpack can be configured to resolve modules with custom extensions, as in Webpack's [`resolve.extensions`](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/resolve/#resolveextensions) configuration. The order of the extensions in the array defines the order in which extensions are attempted to be resolved. Affects both Turbopack and Webpack.

If not specified, it takes the default value `['.js', '.mjs', '.tsx', '.ts', '.jsx', '.json', '.node']`.

```js filename="next.config.js"
module.exports = {
  experimental: {
    resolveExtensions: ['.mdx', '.tsx', '.ts', '.jsx', '.js', '.mjs', '.json'],
  },
}
```

This overwrites the original resolve extensions with the provided list. Make sure to include the default extensions.

For more information and guidance for how to migrate your app to Turbopack from webpack, see [Turbopack's documentation on webpack compatibility](https://turbo.build/pack/docs/migrating-from-webpack).
