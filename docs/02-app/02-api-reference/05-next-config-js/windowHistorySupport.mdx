`windowHistorySupport` is an experimental flag that allows you manually call [`window.history.pushState`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History/pushState) and [`window.history.replaceState`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History/replaceState).

When the flag is enabled, `pushState` and `replaceState` calls are integrated into the Next.js Router, allowing you to sync with [`usePathname`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-pathname) and [`useSearchParams`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-search-params).

To use it, set `windowHistorySupport` to `true` in your `next.config.js` file:

```js fileName="next.config.js"
module.exports = {
  experimental: {
    windowHistorySupport: true,
  },
}
```

See the [Linking and Navigation](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/linking-and-navigating/using-the-native-history-api) documentation for examples.
