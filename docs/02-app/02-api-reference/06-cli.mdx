Next.js comes with **two** Command Line Interface (CLI) tools to help you build your applications:

- **[`create-next-app`](#create-next-app)**: Quickly create a new Next.js application using the default template or an [example](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples) from a public Github repository.
- **[`next`](#next)**: Run the Next.js development server, build your application, and more.

## Examples

## Creating a Next.js app with the default template

To create a new app using the default template, run the following command in your terminal:

{/* TODO: Add code block support for package manager switcher */}

```bash filename="Terminal"
npx create-next-app@latest
```

```bash filename="Terminal"
yarn create next-app
```

```bash filename="Terminal"
pnpm create next-app
```

```bash filename="Terminal"
bun create next-app
```

You will then be asked the following prompts:

```txt filename="Terminal"
What is your project named?  my-app
Would you like to use TypeScript?  No / Yes
Would you like to use ESLint?  No / Yes
Would you like to use Tailwind CSS?  No / Yes
Would you like your code inside a `src/` directory?  No / Yes
Would you like to use App Router? (recommended)  No / Yes
Would you like to use Turbopack for `next dev`?  No / Yes
Would you like to customize the import alias (`@/*` by default)?  No / Yes
```

Once you've answered the prompts, a new project will be created with your chosen configuration.

### Changing the default `PORT`

By default, Next.js uses `http://localhost:3000` during development and with `next start`. The default port can be changed with the `-p` option, like so:

```bash filename="Terminal"
next dev -p 4000
```

Or using the `PORT` environment variable:

```bash filename="Terminal"
PORT=4000 next dev
```

> **Good to know**: `PORT` cannot be set in `.env` as booting up the HTTP server happens before any other code is initialized.

### Using HTTPS during development

For certain use cases like webhooks or authentication, it may be required to use HTTPS to have a secure environment on `localhost`. Next.js can generate a self-signed certificate with `next dev` using the `--experimental-https` flag:

```bash filename="Terminal"
next dev --experimental-https
```

You can also provide a custom certificate and key with `--experimental-https-key` and `--experimental-https-cert`. Optionally, you can provide a custom CA certificate with `--experimental-https-ca` as well.

```bash filename="Terminal"
next dev --experimental-https --experimental-https-key ./certificates/localhost-key.pem --experimental-https-cert ./certificates/localhost.pem
```

`next dev --experimental-https` is only intended for development and creates a locally trusted certificate with [`mkcert`](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert). In production, use properly issued certificates from trusted authorities.

> **Good to know**: When deploying to Vercel, HTTPS is [automatically configured](https://vercel.com/docs/security/encryption) for your Next.js application.
