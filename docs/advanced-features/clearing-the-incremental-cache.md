# Clearing the Incremental Cache

> This document is for Next.js versions 9.5 and up.

In the [Pages documentation](/docs/basic-features/pages.md) and the [Data Fetching documentation](/docs/basic-features/data-fetching.md), we talked about how to pre-render a page at build time (**Static Generation**) using `getStaticProps` and `getStaticPaths`.

Static Generation is useful when your pages fetch data from a headless CMS. However, itâ€™s not ideal when you are wanting your changes to reflect instantly. In this scenario, you would call 'clearIncrementalCache' on the next app and pass in an array of strings.

Note: It is recommend you password protect this route and use it as little as possible.

```js
export default (req, res) => {
  // ...
  app.clearIncrementalCache(['/path-1', '/path-2'])
  res.send({ message: 'Cache Cleared' })

  // ...
}
```
