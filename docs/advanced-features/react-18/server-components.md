# React Server Components

React Server Components allow developers to build applications that span the server and client, combining the rich interactivity of client-side apps with the improved performance of traditional server rendering.

In Next.js 13, you can start using the `app/` directory which uses Server Components by default. Learn more by reading the `app/` directory documentation:

- [Rendering Fundamentals](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering)
- [Server and Client Components](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/react-essentials)

[Deploy the `app/` directory example](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/app-directory) to try Server Components.
