# Streaming SSR

Streaming allows you to incrementally render parts of your UI to the client.

In Next.js 13, you can start using the `app/` directory to take advantage of streaming server-rendering. Learn more by reading the `app/` directory documentation:

- [Streaming and Suspense](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/loading-ui-and-streaming)
- [Instant Loading UI](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/loading-ui-and-streaming)

[Deploy the `app/` directory example](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/app-directory) to try Streaming SSR.
