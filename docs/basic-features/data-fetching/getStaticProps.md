# `getStaticProps`

If you export an `async` function called `getStaticProps` (static generation) from a page, Next.js will pre-render this page at build time using the props returned by `getStaticProps`.

```jsx
export async function getStaticProps(context) {
  return {
    props: {}, // will be passed to the page component as props
  }
}
```

## When should I use `getStaticProps`?

You should use `getStaticProps` if:

- The data required to render the page is available at build time ahead of a user’s request.
- The data comes from a headless CMS.
- The data can be publicly cached (not user-specific).
- The page must be pre-rendered (for SEO) and be very fast — `getStaticProps` generates `HTML` and `JSON` files, both of which can be cached by a CDN for performance.

## TypeScript: Use `GetStaticProps`

You can use the `GetStaticProps` type from `next` to type the function:

```ts
import { GetStaticProps } from 'next'

export const getStaticProps: GetStaticProps = async (context) => {
  // ...
}
```

If you want to get inferred typings for your props, you can use `InferGetStaticPropsType<typeof getStaticProps>`:

```tsx
import { InferGetStaticPropsType } from 'next'

type Post = {
  author: string
  content: string
}

export const getStaticProps = async () => {
  const res = await fetch('https://.../posts')
  const posts: Post[] = await res.json()

  return {
    props: {
      posts,
    },
  }
}

function Blog({ posts }: InferGetStaticPropsType<typeof getStaticProps>) {
  // will resolve posts to type Post[]
}

export default Blog
```

## Using `getStaticProps` to fetch data from a CMS

The following example shows how you can fetch a list of blog posts from a CMS.

```jsx
// posts will be populated at build time by getStaticProps()
function Blog({ posts }) {
  return (
    <ul>
      {posts.map((post) => (
        <li>{post.title}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
}

// This function gets called at build time on server-side.
// It won't be called on client-side, so you can even do
// direct database queries. See the "Technical details" section.
export async function getStaticProps() {
  // Call an external API endpoint to get posts.
  // You can use any data fetching library
  const res = await fetch('https://.../posts')
  const posts = await res.json()

  // By returning { props: { posts } }, the Blog component
  // will receive `posts` as a prop at build time
  return {
    props: {
      posts,
    },
  }
}

export default Blog
```

The [`getStaticProps` API reference](/docs/api-reference/data-fetching/getStaticProps.md) covers all parameters and props that can be used with `getStaticProps`.

## Technical details

### Only runs at build time

Because `getStaticProps` runs at build time, it does **not** receive data that’s only available during request time, such as query parameters or `HTTP` headers as it generates static `HTML`.

### Write server-side code directly

Note that `getStaticProps` runs only on the server-side. It will never be run on the client-side. It won’t even be included in the `JS` bundle for the browser. That means you can write code such as direct database queries without them being sent to browsers.

You should not fetch an **API route** from `getStaticProps` — instead, you can write the server-side code directly in `getStaticProps`.

You can use the [next-code-elimination tool](https://next-code-elimination.vercel.app/) to verify what Next.js eliminates from the client-side bundle.

### Statically Generates both `HTML` and `JSON`

When a page with `getStaticProps` is pre-rendered at build time, in addition to the page `HTML` file, Next.js generates a `JSON` file holding the result of running `getStaticProps`.

This `JSON` file will be used in client-side routing through [`next/link`](/docs/api-reference/next/link.md) or [`next/router`](/docs/api-reference/next/router.md). When you navigate to a page that’s pre-rendered using `getStaticProps`, Next.js fetches this `JSON` file (pre-computed at build time) and uses it as the props for the page component. This means that client-side page transitions will **not** call `getStaticProps` as only the exported `JSON` is used.

When using Incremental Static Generation `getStaticProps` will be executed out of band to generate the `JSON` needed for client-side navigation. You may see this in the form of multiple requests being made for the same page, however, this is intended and has no impact on end-user performance

### Only allowed in a page

`getStaticProps` can only be exported from a **page**. You **cannot** export it from non-page files.

One of the reasons for this restriction is that React needs to have all the required data before the page is rendered.

Also, you must use `export async function getStaticProps() {}` — it will **not** work if you add `getStaticProps` as a property of the page component.

### Runs on every request in development

In development (`next dev`), `getStaticProps` will be called on every request.

### Preview Mode

In some cases, you might want to temporarily bypass Static Generation and render the page at **request time** instead of build time. For example, you might be using a headless CMS and want to preview drafts before they're published.

This use case is supported in Next.js by the [**Preview Mode**](/docs/advanced-features/preview-mode.md) feature.
