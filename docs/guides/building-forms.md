# Building a Serverless Web Form with Vercel and Next.js

Web forms are an important source of communication between a user and a web application. These are used to send data handled by a web server for processing and storage. A web form has a **client-server** relationship. The form itself is the client, and the server is any storage mechanism that can be used to store, retrieve and send data when needed.

This guide will help you learn and create a serverless web form with Next.js (client) and Vercel (server). But let's start with some basics:

## Part 1: [CLIENT] HTML Form

HTML forms are built using the `<form>` tag. It takes a set of attributes and fields to structure the form for features like text fields, checkboxes, dropdown menus, buttons, radio buttons, etc.

Here's the syntax of a simple HTML form:

```html
<!-- Basic HTML Form -->
<form action="/send-data-here" method="post">
  <label for="first">First name:</label>
  <input type="text" id="first" name="first" />
  <label for="last">Last name:</label>
  <input type="text" id="last" name="last" />
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

The front-end looks like this:

![html forms](/docs/guides/images/html-forms.jpg)

The HTML `<form>` tag acts as a container for different `<input>` elements like `text` field and submit `button`. Let's study each of these elements:

- `action`: An attribute that specifies where the form data is sent when the form is submitted. It's generally a URL (an absolute URL or a relative URL).
- `method`: Specifies the HTTP method, i.e., `GET` or `POST` used to send data while submitting the form.
- `<label>`: An element that defines the label for other form elements. Label aids accessibility, especially for screen readers.
- `<input>`: The form element that is widely used to structure the form fields. It depends significantly on the value of the `type` attribute. Input types can be `text`, `checkbox`, `email`, `radio`, and more.
- `<button>`: It represents a clickable button that's used to submit the form data.

### Form Validation

A process that checks if the information provided by a user is correct or not. Form validation also ensures that the provided info is in the correct format (e.g., there's an @ in the email field). These are of two types, i.e.,

- **Client-side**: Validation is done in the browser
- **Server-side**: Validation is done on the server

Though both these types are equally important, for this guide, we'll focus on client-side validation only.

Client-side validation is further categorized as:

- **Built-in**: Uses HTML-based attributes like `required`, `type`, `minLength`, `maxLength`, `pattern` etc.
- **JavaScript-based**: Validation that's coded with JavaScript.

### Built-in Form Validation Using `required`, `type`, `minLength`, `maxLength`

- `required`: Specifies which fields must be filled before submitting the form.
- `type`: Tells whether the data should be a number, email id, text string, etc.
- `minLength`: Decides the minimum length for the text data string.
- `maxLength`: Decides the maximum length for the text data string.

Let's modify the form w.r.t. to these attributes:

```html
<!-- HTML Form with Built-in Validation -->
<form action="/send-data-here" method="post">
  <label for="roll">Roll Number</label>
  <input
    type="text"
    id="roll"
    name="roll"
    required
    minlength="10"
    maxlength="20"
  />
  <label for="name">Name:</label>
  <input type="text" id="name" name="name" required />
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

With these validation checks in place, when a user tries to submit an empty field for Last Name, it gives an error that pops right in the form field. Similarly, a roll number can only be entered if it's 10-20 characters long.

This was a quick recap of setting up web forms in HTML.

## PART 2: [SERVER] Serverless Forms with Vercel and Next.js

Let's jump on to the next part, where you'll be recreating these HTML forms in React using Next.js and Vercel.

Create a simple Next.js app. You can use the [create-next-app](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started#setup) for a quick start. In your command line terminal, run the following:

```
npx create-next-app
```

Answer the few questions to create your project, I created a project called `next-forms` and then `cd` into this directory. Now run the `npm run dev` or `yarn dev` command to start the development server.

Now read the localhost URL printed in the command line. Generally it's `http://localhost:3000`. Open this URL to ensure that your app is running successfully.

## Setting up the Serverless Environment

At the beginning of this guide, you learned that web forms have a client-server relationship. So, let's set up the server environment using Vercel.

Vercel supports out-the-box deployment of [Serverless Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/serverless-functions), which you can code in your favorite backend languages (Node.js, Go, Python and Ruby). These functions take an HTTP request and return a response.

Serverless functions perform a significant role in handling tasks like form submission because:

- Serverless functions are event-based, and every time you submit a form, it triggers a new event.
- Offer faster deployments with greater flexibility (you don't have to manage any servers).
- Reduce architecture and management costs.

### Next.js Form Serverless API Endpoint

Since we are using Next.js â€” we will build both the client and the server with it. For the server part, let's create a serverless API where we'll send the form data.

In case you don't know, Next.js offers a file-based system for routing that's built on the [concept of pages](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages). Any file inside the folder `pages/api` is mapped to `/api/*` and will be treated as an API endpoint instead of a page. This API endpoint is going to be server-side only.

Go to `pages/api`, create a file called `form.js` and paste this code written in Node.js:

```js
export default function handler(req, res) {
  // Get data submitted in request's body.
  const body = req.body

  // Optional logging to see the responses
  // in the command line where next.js app is running.
  console.log('body: ', body)

  // Both of these are required.
  if (!body.first || !body.last) {
    return res.json({ data: 'First or last name not found' })
  }

  // Found the name.
  res.json({ data: `${body.first} ${body.last}` })
}
```

This serverless form `handler` function will receive the request `req` from the client (i.e., submitted form data). And in return, it'll send a response `res` as JSON that will have both the first and the last name. You can access this API endpoint at `http://localhost:3000/api/form` or replace the localhost URL with an actual Vercel deployment when you deploy.

> Moreover, you can also attach this API to a database like MongoDB or Google Sheets. This way, your submitted form data will be securely stored for later use. For this guide, no database is used. Instead, the same data is returned to the user to demo how it's done.

### Form Submission without JavaScript

Now we can use `/api/form` relative endpoint inside the `action` attribute for our form. We are sending form data to our server (serverless API at Vercel) when the form is submitted via `POST` HTTP method (which is used to send data).

```html
<form action="/send-data-here" method="post">
  <label for="first">First name:</label>
  <input type="text" id="first" name="first" />
  <label for="last">Last name:</label>
  <input type="text" id="last" name="last" />
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

If you submit this form, it will submit the data to our forms API endpoint `/api/form`. The server then responds, generally handling the data and loading the URL defined by the action attribute, causing a new page load. So in this case you'll be redirected to `http://localhost:3000/api/form` with the following response from the server.

![form-no-js](/docs/guides/images/form-no-js.jpg)

## PART 3: Forms in Next.js

We created a server with Vercel via serverless functions. Now it's time to configure the client (the form itself) inside Next.js using React. The first step will be extending your knowledge of HTML forms and converting it into React (using [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html)).

Here's the same form in a [React function component](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html) written using [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html).

```js
export default function Page() {
  return (
    <form action="/api/form" method="post">
      <label htmlFor="first">First Name</label>
      <input type="text" id="first" name="first" required />

      <label htmlFor="last">Last Name</label>
      <input type="text" id="last" name="last" required />

      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  )
}
```

Here's what changed:

- The `for` attribute is changed to `htmlFor`. (Since `for` is a keyword associated with the "for" loop in JavaScript, React elements use `htmlFor` instead.)
- The `action` attribute now has a relative URL, the form API endpoint deployed at Vercel.

This completes the basic structure of your Next.js-based form.

## PART 4: Form Submission without JavaScript

JavaScript brings interactivity to our web applications, but sometimes you need to control the JavaScript size from being too big.

There are several reasons why users disable JavaScript, e.g., addressing bandwidth constraints, increasing device (phone or laptop) battery life, and even for privacy so they wonâ€™t be tracked with analytical scripts. Regardless of the reason, disabling JavaScript will impact site functionality partially, if not completely.

But with Vercel serverless functions, we can still use the forms without JavaScript, as we saw in the **Form Submission without JavaScript** section above.

For that go to the `next-forms` directory. Inside the `/pages` directory, create a file `no-js-form.js`.

> **Quick Tip**: In Next.js, a page is a React Component exported from a `.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, or `.tsx` file in the pages directory. Each page is associated with a route based on its file name.
>
> Example: If you create `pages/no-js-form.js`, it will be accessible at `your-domain.tld/no-js-form`.

Let's use the same code from above:

```js
export default function PageWithoutJSbasedForm() {
  return (
    <form action="/api/form" method="post">
      <label htmlFor="first">First Name</label>
      <input type="text" id="first" name="first" required />

      <label htmlFor="last">Last Name</label>
      <input type="text" id="last" name="last" required />

      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  )
}
```

With JavaScript disabled, when you hit the Submit button, an event is triggered, which collects the form data and sends it to our forms API endpoint as defined in the `action` attribute and using `POST` HTTP `method`. You'll be redirected to the `/api/form` endpoint since that's how form `action` works.

The form data will be submitted on the server as a request `req` to the form handler function we wrote above. It will process the data and return a JSON string as a response `res` with your submitted name in it.

## Part 5: Form Submission with JavaScript Enabled

Let's handle the form submission with JavaScript, which offers much more robust functionality.

Inside `/pages`, you'll create another file called `js-form.js`. This will create a `/js-form` page on your Next.js app.

Now, as soon as the form is submitted, we prevent the form's default behavior of reloading the page. We'll take the form data, convert it to JSON string, and send it to our server, the API endpoint. Finally, our server will respond with the name submitted. All of this with a simple JavaScript `handleSubmit()` function.

Here's what this function looks like. It's well documented for you to understand each step:

```js
export default function PageWithJSbasedForm() {
  // Handles the submit event on form submit.
  const handleSubmit = async (event) => {
    // Stop the form from submitting and refreshing the page.
    event.preventDefault()

    // Get data from the form.
    const data = {
      first: event.target.first.value,
      last: event.target.last.value,
    }

    // Send the data to the server in JSON format.
    const JSONdata = JSON.stringify(data)

    // API endpoint where we send form data.
    const endpoint = '/api/form'

    // Form the request for sending data to the server.
    const options = {
      // The method is POST because we are sending data.
      method: 'POST',
      // Tell the server we're sending JSON.
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      },
      // Body of the request is the JSON data we created above.
      body: JSONdata,
    }

    // Send the form data to our forms API on Vercel and get a response.
    const response = await fetch(endpoint, options)

    // Get the response data from server as JSON.
    // If server returns the name submitted, that means the form works.
    const result = await response.json()
    alert(`Is this your full name: ${result.data}`)
  }
  return (
    // We pass the event to the handleSubmit() function on submit.
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <label htmlFor="first">First Name</label>
      <input type="text" id="first" name="first" required />

      <label htmlFor="last">Last Name</label>
      <input type="text" id="last" name="last" required />

      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  )
}
```

It's a Next.js page with a React function component called `PageWithJSbasedForm` with a `<form>` element written in JSX. There's no action on the `<form>` element. Instead, we use the `onSubmit` event handler to send data to our `{handleSubmit}` function.

The `handleSubmit()` function processes your form data through a series of steps:

- The `event.preventDefault()` stops the `<form>` element from refreshing the entire page.
- We created a JavaScript object called `data` with the `first` and `last` values from the form.
- JSON is a language-agnostic data transfer format. So we use `JSON.stringify(data)` to convert the data to JSON.
- We then use `fetch()` to send the data to our `/api/form` endpoint using JSON and HTTP `POST` method.
- Server sends back a response with the name submitted. Woohoo! ðŸ¥³
