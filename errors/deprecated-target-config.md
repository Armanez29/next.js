# Deprecated target config

#### Why This Error Occurred

The `target` in `next.config.js` has been deprecated. Please migrate to leverage the default target instead.

#### Possible Ways to Fix It

For serverless cases, leverage the new output file traces or deploy your application somewhere where they are leveraged automatically.
