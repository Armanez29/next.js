title: Export with Image Optimization API
---

## `export-image-api`

#### Why This Error Occurred

You configured `output: 'export'` (or ran `next export`) while importing the `next/image` component using the default `loader` configuration.

However, the default `loader` relies on the Image Optimization API which is not available for exported applications.

This is because Next.js optimizes images on-demand, as users request them (not at build time).

#### Possible Ways to Fix It

- Use [`next start`](/docs/api-reference/cli#production) to run a server, which includes the Image Optimization API.
- Use any provider which supports Image Optimization (such as [Vercel](https://vercel.com)).
- [Configure `loader`](/docs/api-reference/next/image#loader-configuration) in `next.config.js`.
- [Configure `unoptimized`](/docs/api-reference/next/image#unoptimized) in `next.config.js`.
