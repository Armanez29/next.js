title: Missing Suspense with CSR Bailout
---

#### Why This Error Occurred

Reading search parameters through `useSearchParams()` without a Suspense boundary will opt the entire page into client-side rendering. This could cause your page to be blank until the client-side JavaScript has loaded.

#### Possible Ways to Fix It

Ensure that calls to `useSearchParams()` are wrapped in a Suspense boundary.

```tsx title="app/page.tsx"
import { SearchBar } from './search'
import { Suspense } from 'react'

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
      <SearchBar />
    </Suspense>
  )
}
```

```jsx title="app/search.tsx"
'use client'

import { useSearchParams } from 'next/navigation'

export function Search() {
  const searchParams = useSearchParams()

  return '...'
}
```

This will ensure the page does not de-opt to client-side rendering.

#### Disabling

We don't recommend disabling this rule. However, if you need to, you can disable it by setting the `missingSuspenseWithCSRBailout` option to `false` in your `next.config.js`:

```js filename="next.config.js"
module.exports = {
  experimental: {
    missingSuspenseWithCSRBailout: false,
  },
}
```

This configuration option will be removed in a future major version.
