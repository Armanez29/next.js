title: next/headers methods were called outside request/render scope
---

## ``

#### Why This Error Occurred

Either `headers()` or `cookies()` were invokned at place where no request information was available (eg.: Global scope, outside the React lifecycle).

Note that `headers()` and `cookies()` could be called deep inside other modules/functions (eg.: third-party libraries) that are not immediately visible.

#### Possible Ways to Fix It

Make sure that all `headers()` and `cookies()` calls happen in a request/render scope.

Example:

```diff
// app/page.ts
import { cookies } from 'next/headers'

- const cookieStore  = cookies()
export default function Page() {
+ const cookieStore = cookies()
  return ...
}
```

```diff
// app/foo/route.ts
import { headers } from 'next/headers'

- const headersList = headers()
export async function GET() {
+ const headersList = headers()
  return ...
}
```
