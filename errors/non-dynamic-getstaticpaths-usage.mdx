## `non-dynamic-getstaticpaths-usage`

#### Why This Error Occurred

On a non-dynamic SSG page `getStaticPaths` was incorrectly exported as this can only be used on dynamic pages to return the paths to prerender.

#### Possible Ways to Fix It

Remove the `getStaticPaths` export on the non-dynamic page or rename the page to be a dynamic page.
