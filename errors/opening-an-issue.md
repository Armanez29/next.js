# Opening a new Issue

#### Why This Message Occurred

When `next info` was run, Next.js detected that it's was not on the latest canary release.

`next@canary` is the beta version of Next.js. It includes all features and fixes that are pending to land on the stable release line.

Some issues might have already been fixed there, so before opening a new issue on the repository, make sure to verify if the issue hasn't been fixed there already.

Run the following in the codebase:

```sh
npm install next@canary
```

or

```
yarn add next@canary
```

And go through the prepared reproduction steps once again, and check if the issue still exists.
