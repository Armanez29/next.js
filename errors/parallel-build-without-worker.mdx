title: Parallel Build Without Build Worker
---

## Why This Error Occurred

The `experimental.parallelServerAndEdgeCompiles` and `experimental.parallelServerBuildTraces`
options require that the `experimental.webpackBuildWorker` option is set to `true`. These
options use workers to improve the paralellization of the build which may improve performance,
but the build may use more memory at the same time.

## Possible Ways to Fix It

Build workers are enabled by default unless you have a custom webpack config.
You can force enable the option by setting `config.experimental.webpackBuildWorker: true` in the config,
but some webpack configurations may not be compatible.
