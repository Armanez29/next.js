title: Understanding the postpone error triggered during static generation
---

## Why This Error Occurred

When Partial Pre-Rendering (PPR) is enabled, using APIs that opt into Dynamic Rendering like `cookies`, `headers`, or `fetch` (such as with `cache: 'no-store'` or `revalidate: 0`) will cause Next.js to throw a special indicator to know which part of the page cannot be statically generated. If you catch this error, Next.js will not be able to leverage this performance optimization and will fallback to dynamic rendering.

## Possible Ways to Fix It

To resolve this issue, ensure that you are not wrapping Next.js APIs that opt into dynamic rendering in a `try/catch` block.
