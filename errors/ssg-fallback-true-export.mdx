## `ssg-fallback-true-export`

#### Why This Error Occurred

You attempted to export a page with a `fallback: true` return value from `getStaticPaths` which is invalid. `fallback: true` is meant for building pages on-demand after a build has occurred, exporting disables this functionality

#### Possible Ways to Fix It

If you would like the `fallback: true` behavior, you must remove `output: 'export'` and remove `next export` in favor of a different [deployment solution](/docs/pages/building-your-application/deploying).
