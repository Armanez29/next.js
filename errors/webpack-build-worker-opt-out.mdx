title: Webpack Build Worker automatic opt-out
---

## ``

#### Why This Error Occurred

The Next.js config contained a custom webpack configuration, as a result, the Webpack build worker was disabled.

#### Possible Ways to Fix It

You can force enable the option via setting &#x60;config.experimental.webpackBuildWorker: true&#x60; in the config.
