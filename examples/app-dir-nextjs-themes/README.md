# Example app with [nextjs-themes](https://github.com/mayank1513/nextjs-themes) and TypeScript

This example features how to use [nextjs-themes](https://github.com/mayank1513/nextjs-themes) to quickly add multiple themes to your Next.js app with TypeScript and app router. This package helps you add themes that are synced with browser tabs as well as server components. Enjoy theming while retaining the full potential of React Server Components.

Next.js and nextjs-themes have built-in TypeScript declarations, so we'll get autocompletion for their modules straight away.

We replace the `html` tag in root layout with `SSCWrapper` to avoid flash of un-themed content on load/realod.
