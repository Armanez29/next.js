# CDN Asset example

## How to use

Download the example [or clone the repo](https://github.com/zeit/next.js):

```bash
curl https://codeload.github.com/zeit/next.js/tar.gz/master | tar -xz --strip=2 next.js-master/examples/cdn-assets
cd cdn-assets
```

Install it and run:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Deploy it to the cloud with [now](https://zeit.co/now) ([download](https://zeit.co/download))

```bash
now
```

## The idea behind the example

Next.js will serve your generated assets by default, but in some situations you'll want to use an external CDN to help speed up your app. This example displays how this is possible with Next.js.
