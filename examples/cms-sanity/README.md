# A statically generated blog example using Next.js and Sanity

This example showcases Next.js's [Static Generation](/docs/basic-features/pages.md) feature using [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io/) as the data source.

## How to use

### Using `create-next-app`

Execute [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) with [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/init) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/create/) to bootstrap the example:

```bash
npm init next-app --example cms-Sanity cms-Sanity-app
# or
yarn create next-app --example cms-Sanity cms-Sanity-app
```

### Download manually

Download the example:

```bash
curl https://codeload.github.com/zeit/next.js/tar.gz/canary | tar -xz --strip=2 next.js-canary/examples/cms-Sanity
cd cms-sanity
```

## Configuration

### Step 1. Create an account and a project on Sanity

First, [create an account on Sanity](https://sanity.io).

After creating an account, install the Sanity cli from npm `npm i -g @sanity/cli`.

### Step 2. Create a new Sanity project

In a separate folder run `sanity init` to initialize a new studio project.

This will be where we manage our data.

When going through the init phase make sure to select **Yes** to the **Use the default dataset configuration** step and select **Clean project with no predefined schemas** for the **Select project template** step.

After initializing get the `projectId` and `dataset` values from the `sanity.json` file that was generated and add them to `lib/sanity.js` in the example.

### Step 3. Create an `Author` schema

In your Sanity studio project open `schemas/schema.js` and add the following schema that will be used for authors inside of `schemaTypes.concat([])`

```js
{
  name: 'author',
  type: 'document',
  title: 'Author',
  fields: [
    {
      name: 'name',
      title: 'Name',
      type: 'string'
    },
    {
      name: 'picture',
      title: 'Picture',
      type: 'image'
    },
  ]
}
```

### Step 4. Create a `Post` schema

In the same file that we edited above `schemas/schema.js` add the following schema that will be used for posts.

```js
{
  name: 'post',
  type: 'document',
  title: 'Post',
  fields: [
    {
      name: 'title',
      title: 'Title',
      type: 'string'
    },
    {
      name: 'content',
      title: 'Content',
      type: 'array',
      of: [{type: 'block'}]
    },
    {
      name: 'excerpt',
      title: 'Excerpt',
      type: 'string'
    },
    {
      name: 'coverImage',
      title: 'Cover Image',
      type: 'image',
    },
    {
      name: 'date',
      title: 'Date',
      type: 'datetime',
    },
    {
      name: 'author',
      title: 'Author',
      type: 'reference',
      to: [{ type: 'author' }]
    },
    {
      name: 'slug',
      title: 'Slug',
      type: 'slug'
    }
  ]
}
```

### Step 4. Populate Content

To add some content go to your Sanity studio project where we added the schema types and run `sanity start`.

After the project has started and you have navigated to the provided URL, select **Author** and create a new record.

- You just need **1 Author record**.
- Use dummy data for the text.
- For the image, you can download one from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/).

Next, select **Post** and create a new record.

- We recommend creating at least **2 Post records**.
- Use dummy data for the text.
- You can write markdown for the **Content** field.
- For the images, you can download ones from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/).
- Pick the **Author** you created earlier.

**Important:** For each post record, you need to click **Publish** after saving. If not, the post will be in the draft state.

### Step 5. Set up environment variables

Go to the **Settings** menu at the top and click **API tokens**.

Then click **Read-only API token** and copy the token.

Next, copy the `.env.example` file in this directory to `.env` (which will be ignored by Git):

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then set each variable on `.env`:

- `NEXT_EXAMPLE_CMS_Sanity_API_TOKEN` should be the API token you just copied.
- `NEXT_EXAMPLE_CMS_Sanity_PREVIEW_SECRET` can be any random string (but avoid spaces), like `MY_SECRET` - this is used for [the Preview Mode](/docs/advanced-features/preview-mode.md).

Your `.env` file should look like this:

```bash
NEXT_EXAMPLE_CMS_Sanity_API_TOKEN=...
NEXT_EXAMPLE_CMS_Sanity_PREVIEW_SECRET=...
```

### Step 6. Run Next.js in development mode

```bash
npm install
npm run dev

# or

yarn install
yarn dev
```

Your blog should be up and running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)! If it doesn't work, post on [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/discussions).

### Step 7. Try preview mode

On Sanity, go to one of the posts you've created and:

- **Update the title**. For example, you can add `[Draft]` in front of the title.
- Click **Save**, but **DO NOT** click **Publish**. By doing this, the post will be in the draft state.

(If it doesn't become draft, you need to go to the model settings for `Post`, go to **Additional Settings**, and turn on **Enable draft/published system**.)

Now, if you go to the post page on localhost, you won't see the updated title. However, if you use the **Preview Mode**, you'll be able to see the change ([Documentation](/docs/advanced-features/preview-mode.md)).

To enable the Preview Mode, go to this URL:

```
http://localhost:3000/api/preview?secret=<secret>&slug=<slug>
```

- `<secret>` should be the string you entered for `NEXT_EXAMPLE_CMS_Sanity_PREVIEW_SECRET`.
- `<slug>` should be the post's `slug` attribute (you can check on Sanity).

You should now be able to see the updated title. To exit the preview mode, you can click **Click here to exit preview mode** at the top.

### Step 8. Deploy on ZEIT Now

You can deploy this app to the cloud with [ZEIT Now](https://zeit.co/import?filter=next.js&utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=next-example) ([Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment)).

To deploy on ZEIT Now, you need to set the environment variables with **Now Secrets** using [Now CLI](https://zeit.co/download) ([Documentation](https://zeit.co/docs/now-cli#commands/secrets)).

Install [Now CLI](https://zeit.co/download), log in to your account from the CLI, and run the following commands to add the environment variables. Replace `<NEXT_EXAMPLE_CMS_Sanity_API_TOKEN>` and `<NEXT_EXAMPLE_CMS_Sanity_PREVIEW_SECRET>` with the corresponding strings in `.env`.

```
now secrets add next_example_cms_Sanity_api_token <NEXT_EXAMPLE_CMS_Sanity_API_TOKEN>
now secrets add next_example_cms_Sanity_preview_secret <NEXT_EXAMPLE_CMS_Sanity_PREVIEW_SECRET>
```

Then push the project to GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket and [import to ZEIT Now](https://zeit.co/import?filter=next.js&utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=next-example) to deploy.
