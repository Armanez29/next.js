# CSS Hooks Example

This example project showcases how [CSS Hooks](https://css-hooks.com) can revolutionize your styling approach in a Next.js application. Hooks allow you to tap into advanced CSS features without leaving the `style` prop. That means you can use pseudo-classes, media queries, container queries, or even selector logic within native inline styles, with no extra build steps or expensive runtime side effects. The "magic" is entirely based on a CSS Variables trick described [here](https://nsaunders.dev/posts/css-madness-to-hooks#the-fallback-trick).
