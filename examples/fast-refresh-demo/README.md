# Fast Refresh Demo

Next.js ships with [Fast Refresh](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/fast-refresh) which gives you instantaneous feedback on edits made to your React components.

This example shows an auto incrementing value, a classic counter and an error counter. Most edits should be visible within a second, without losing component state.

## Usage

Run the following command to get started:

```bash
yarn
yarn dev
# or
npm install
npm run dev
```
