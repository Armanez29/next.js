# Mongoose example

> [**Mongoose**](https://mongoosejs.com/) provides a straight-forward, schema-based solution to model your application data. It includes built-in type casting, validation, query building, business logic hooks and more, out of the box.

**Next.js** v9.3 add a feature called [Static Site Generation (SSG)](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-9-3#next-gen-static-site-generation-ssg-support) that allows to write server code in `pages`, by example directly connect to DB ðŸ˜Ž.
