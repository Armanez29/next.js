# MQTT Client example

This example shows how to use the MQTT.js client with next.js.
Thanks @ [jamesmosier](https://github.com/jamesmosier) for the startup advice.

## How to use

npm install or npm i

Define a connection URI, options and handlers per topic for incomming messages.
Then pass them to the useMqtt hook that returns a connected client instance.

## MQTT.js

For more information on the mqtt client or the options object, consult the documentation: [MQTT.js](https://github.com/mqttjs/MQTT.js)
