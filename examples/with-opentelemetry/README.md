# OpenTelemetry example

OpenTelemetry is a very useful tool and that't why baked it into next.js itself.
You can veary easily setup your own instrumentation integration with custom `instrumentation.ts` file.

In order to be able to collect and inspect traces generated by OpenTelemetry you need to run your own OpenTelemetry collector and a backend for visualising your traces. We have included a modified version of [OpenTelemetry example](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/examples/demo) which contains configured open telemetry collector with multiple backeds.

You can run the collector with backeds by running `docker-compose up -d` in `opentelemetry-infra/`.
Running tha tcommand will expose the following backeds:

- Jaeger at http://0.0.0.0:16686
- Zipkin at http://0.0.0.0:9411
- Prometheus at http://0.0.0.0:9090

## How to use

Execute [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) with [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/init), [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/create/), or [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) to bootstrap the example:

```bash
npx create-next-app --example with-opentelemetry with-opentelemetry-app
```

```bash
yarn create next-app --example with-opentelemetry with-opentelemetry-app
```

```bash
pnpm create next-app --example with-opentelemetry with-opentelemetry-app
```

Deploy it to the cloud with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/new?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=next-example) ([Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment)).
