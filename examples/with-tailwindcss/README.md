# Next.js + Tailwind CSS Example

Tailwind CSS is integrated into the `create-next-app` CLI, which supports TypeScript and JavaScript, as well as the App Router (`app/`) and the pages directory `pages/`.

To get started, run:

```bash
pnpm create next-app --tailwind`
```

```bash
yarn create next-app --tailwind`
```

```bash
npx create-next-app --tailwind`
```
