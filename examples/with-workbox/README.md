## The idea behind the example

Next.js works well with [workbox](https://workboxjs.org/) the new Service Worker library from google that will help you cache your pages, and content that comes from cdns.
In this example, We are caching the pages and an addition to that, we are also caching images from github, and shows from the TV Maze API. Check the `generate-sw.js` for more info on how and what is being cached.
